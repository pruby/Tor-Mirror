<a name="installing"></a>
<h2>Installing Tor</h2>

<p>You can get the latest releases <a
href="http://tor.freehaven.net/dist/">here</a>. Look for the highest
version (most recent date) that includes "-win32.exe".
</p>

<p>Our Tor installer should make everything pretty simple:
</p>

[screenshot for Tor installer that looks comforting]

<p>It will run Tor in a dos window so you can see its logs and
errors. (You can minimize this window, but do not close it.)
</p>

<p>Tor comes configured as a client by default. It uses a built-in
default configuration file, and most people won't need to change any of
the settings.</p>

<p>After installing Tor, you should install <a
href="http://www.privoxy.org/">privoxy</a>, which is a filtering web proxy
that integrates well with Tor. Privoxy will appear in your system tray:
</p>

<img alt="privoxy icon in the system tray" src="http://tor.freehaven.net/img/GCS_004.jpg" />

<p>You need to configure Privoxy to use Tor. Open Privoxy's main config file:</p>

<img alt="editing privoxy config" src="http://tor.freehaven.net/img/GCS_053.jpg" />

<p>Add the line <br>
<tt>forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .</tt><br>
(don't forget the dot) to privoxy's config file (you can just add it to the
top):</p>

<img alt="privoxy points to tor" src="http://tor.freehaven.net/img/GCS_006.jpg" />

<p>Then change your browser to http proxy at localhost port 8118.
In Mozilla, this is in Edit|Preferences|Advanced|Proxies. In IE, it's
Tools|Internet Options|Connections|LAN Settings|Advanced.
You should also set your SSL proxy (IE calls it "Secure") to the same
thing, to hide your SSL traffic:</p>

<img alt="privoxy points to tor" src="http://tor.freehaven.net/img/GCS_002.jpg" />

<p>Using privoxy is <b>necessary</b> because <a
href="http://tor.freehaven.net/cvs/tor/doc/CLIENTS">Mozilla leaks your
DNS requests when it uses a socks proxy directly</a>. Privoxy also gives
you good html scrubbing.</p>

<p>To test if it's working, go to <a
href="http://www.junkbusters.com/cgi-bin/privacy">http://www.junkbusters.com/cgi-bin/privacy</a>
and see what IP it says you're coming from.
</p>

<p>
If you have a personal firewall, be sure to allow local connections to
port 8118 and port 9050. If your firewall blocks outgoing connections,
punch a hole so it can connect to TCP ports 80, 443, and 9001-9033.
For more troubleshooting suggestions, see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ">the FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>To Torify an application that supports http, just point it at
Privoxy. To use socks directly, point it at localhost port 9050. For
applications that support neither socks nor http, take a look at either <a
href="http://www.socks.permeo.com/Download/SocksCapDownload/index.asp">SocksCap</a>
or the <a
href="http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/socks/index.html?cks=y">Hummingbird</a>
SOCKS client. Let us know if you get them working so we can add better
instructions here.</p>

<h2>Configuring a hidden service</h2>

<p>Tor allows clients and servers to offer <em>hidden services</em>. That
is, you can offer an apache, sshd, etc, without revealing your IP to its
users. This works via Tor's rendezvous point design: both sides build
a Tor circuit out, and they meet in the middle.</p>

<p>Once you've installed Tor and Privoxy, you can <a
href="http://6sxoyfb3h2nvok2d.onion/">go to the hidden wiki</a> to see
hidden services in action.</p>

<p>To set up a hidden service, edit your torrc:</p>

[screenshot here of clicking on tor|torrc]

<p>Edit the middle part to enable your service. Then restart Tor. It will
create each HiddenServiceDir you have configured, and it will create a
'hostname' file which specifies the url (xyz.onion) for that service. You
can tell people the url, and they can connect to it via their Tor client,
assuming they're also using Tor and Privoxy.</p>
