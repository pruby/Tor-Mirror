<h1>Running the <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a> client on Win32</h1>

<a name="installing"></a>
<h2>Step One: Download and Install Tor</h2>
<p>
<b>Note that this is the installation instructions for running a client on Win32. 
If you want to run a server, please read the "Configuring a server" section in 
<a href="./tor-doc.html">tor-doc.html</a>.</b>
</p>
<p>
This document was updated March 29 2005.
</p>
<p>
The latest beta release of Tor for Windows 32 is 
<a href="http://tor.eff.org/dist/win32/tor-0.1.0.1-rc-win32.exe">0.1.0.1-rc</a>.
Download it by clicking the link. You may be able to find experimental versions
<a href="http://tor.eff.org/dist/win32/">here</a>, if you're looking for
new features and new bugs.
</p>

<p>Our Tor installer should make everything pretty simple. Below is a
screenshot of the setup page (your version will probably be newer than
the version printed in this screenshot):
</p>

<p>
By default, Tor is not configured to run at startup.
<!--We highly recommend that you enable that feature, however. -->
You can enable this by checking the "Run at startup" box as shown below.
Be sure to leave the other boxes checked.
</p>

<p>Once the installer is finished, it will run Tor in a DOS window so
you can see its logs and errors. (You can minimize this window, but do
not close it.)
</p>

<p>Tor comes configured as a client by default. It uses a built-in
default configuration file, and most people won't need to change any of
the settings. Tor is now installed.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Install Privoxy for Web Browsing</h2>

<p>After installing Tor, you need to configure your applications to use it.
The first step is to set up web browsing. Start by installing <a
href="http://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> (click on 'recent releases',
then scroll down to the Win32 installer packages). Privoxy is a filtering
web proxy that integrates well with Tor. Once it's installed, it should
appear in your system tray as a "P" in a circle, as pictured below:
</p>

<img alt="privoxy icon in the system tray"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-win32-privoxy-icon.jpg" />

<p>You need to configure Privoxy to use Tor.
Open Privoxy's main config file by selecting it from Start Menu|All
Programs:
</p>

<img border="1" alt="editing privoxy config"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-win32-privoxy-config.jpg" />

<p>Add the line <br>
<tt>forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .</tt><br>
to Privoxy's config file. Don't forget to add the dot at the end.
The easiest way is to select the above line and copy/paste it into
the file. Be sure to save.

<h2>Step Three: Configure your applications to use Tor</h2>

<p>Then change your browser to HTTP proxy at localhost port 8118.
(That's where Privoxy listens.)
In Firefox it's Firefox|Preferences|General|ConnectionSettings.
In Mozilla, this is in Edit|Preferences|Advanced|Proxies. In IE, it's
Tools|Internet Options|Connections|LAN Settings|Advanced.
You should also set your SSL proxy (IE calls it "Secure") to the same
thing, to hide your SSL traffic too. In IE, this looks something like:</p>

<img alt="Proxy settings in IE"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-win32-ie-proxies.jpg" />

<p>Using privoxy is <strong>necessary</strong> because <a
href="http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/CLIENTS">browsers leak your
DNS requests when they use a SOCKS proxy directly</a>, which is bad for
your anonymity. Privoxy also removes certain dangerous headers from your
web requests, and blocks obnoxious ad sites like Doubleclick.</p>

<p>To test if it's working, go to 
<a href="http://peertech.org/privacy-knoppix/">peertech</a>,
<a href="http://www.junkbusters.com/cgi-bin/privacy">junkbusters</a>,
<a href="http://www.network-tools.com">network-tools</a> or
<a href="http://ipid.shat.net">ipid</a>
and see what IP it says you're coming from.
</p>
<p>
If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's ability
to connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from your local
applications to
local port 8118 and port 9050. If your firewall blocks outgoing connections,
punch a hole so it can connect to at least TCP ports 80, 443, and 9001-9033.

</p>

<p>To Torify another application that supports HTTP, just point it at Privoxy
(that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS directly (for example, for
instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), point your application directly at
Tor (localhost port 9050). For applications that support neither SOCKS
nor HTTP, take a look at <a
href="http://www.socks.permeo.com/Download/SocksCapDownload/index.asp">SocksCap</a>,
<a href="http://www.freecap.ru/eng/">FreeCap</a>,
or the <a
href="http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/socks/index.html?cks=y">Hummingbird</a>
SOCKS client. (FreeCap is free software; the others are proprietary.)<br />
