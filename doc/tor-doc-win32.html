<a name="installing"></a>
<h2>Installing Tor</h2>

<p>
The latest release of Tor for Windows 32 is <a
href="http://tor.freehaven.net/dist/win32/tor-0.0.9.1-win32.exe">0.0.9.1</a>.
Download it by clicking the link. You may also be able to find other
versions <a href="http://tor.freehaven.net/dist/win32/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>Our Tor installer should make everything pretty simple:
</p>

<p>
By default, Tor is not configured to run at startup.
<!--We highly recommend that you enable that feature, however. -->
You can enable this by checking the "Run at startup" box as shown below.
Be sure to leave the other boxes checked.
</p>

<p>It will run Tor in a DOS window so you can see its logs and
errors. (You can minimize this window, but do not close it.)
</p>

<p>Tor comes configured as a client by default. It uses a built-in
default configuration file, and most people won't need to change any of
the settings. Tor is now installed.</p>

<p>After installing Tor, you should install <a
href="http://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> (click on 'recent releases',
then scroll down to the Win32 installer packages). Privoxy is a filtering
web proxy that integrates well with Tor. Once it's installed, it should
appear in your system tray, as pictured below:
</p>

<img alt="privoxy icon in the system tray" src="http://tor.freehaven.net/img/GCS_004.jpg" />

<p>You need to configure Privoxy to use Tor.
Open Privoxy's main config file by selecting it from "Start Menu"|"All
Programs":
</p>

<img border="1" alt="editing privoxy config" src="http://tor.freehaven.net/img/GCS_053.jpg" />

<p>Add the line <br>
<tt>forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .</tt><br>
to Privoxy's config file. Don't forget to add the dot at the end.
The easiest way is to select the above line and copy/paste it into
the file. Be sure to save.
</p>

<p>Then change your browser to http proxy at localhost port 8118.
In Mozilla, this is in Edit|Preferences|Advanced|Proxies. In IE, it's
Tools|Internet Options|Connections|LAN Settings|Advanced.
You should also set your SSL proxy (IE calls it "Secure") to the same
thing, to hide your SSL traffic. In IE, this looks something like:</p>

<p>Using privoxy is <b>necessary</b> because <a
href="http://tor.freehaven.net/cvs/tor/doc/CLIENTS">browsers leak your
DNS requests when they use a socks proxy directly</a>, which is bad for
your anonymity. Privoxy also removes certain dangerous headers from your
web requests, and also blocks obnoxious ad sites like Doubleclick.</p>

<p>To test if it's working, go to <a
href="http://peertech.org/privacy-knoppix/">this site</a> and see
what IP it says you're coming from. (If it's down, you can try the
<a href="http://www.junkbusters.com/cgi-bin/privacy">junkbusters</a>
site instead.)</p>

<p>
If you have a personal firewall, be sure to allow local connections to
port 8118 and port 9050. If your firewall blocks outgoing connections,
punch a hole so it can connect to TCP ports 80, 443, and 9001-9033.

</p>

<p>To Torify an application that supports http, just point it at
Privoxy. To use socks directly, point it at localhost port 9050. For
applications that support neither socks nor http, take a look at either <a
href="http://www.socks.permeo.com/Download/SocksCapDownload/index.asp">SocksCap</a>
or the <a
href="http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/socks/index.html?cks=y">Hummingbird</a>
SOCKS client. Let us know if you get them working so we can add better
instructions here.</p>
