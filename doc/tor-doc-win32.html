<h1>Running the <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a> client on MS Windows</h1>

<a name="installing"></a>
<h2>Step One: Download and Install Tor</h2>
<p>
<b>Note that these are the installation instructions for running a
client on MS Windows (98, 98SE, NT4, 2000, XP, Server)
If you want to run a server (please do), read the "Configuring a server" section at
<a href="tor-doc.html#server">tor-doc.html</a>.</b>
</p>
<p>
This document was updated $Date$.
</p>
<p>
The latest beta release of Tor for MS Windows is
<a href="http://tor.eff.org/dist/win32/tor-0.1.0.11-win32.exe">0.1.0.11</a>.
Download it by clicking the link. You may be able to find experimental versions

<a href="http://tor.eff.org/dist/win32/">here</a>, if you're looking for
new features and new bugs.
</p>

<p>
If you want to run Tor in the system
tray and/or as a service have a look at this <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#Win32SystemTrayService">FAQ
entry</a>. If you dont mind running in a window (so you can see its logs
and errors) our Tor installer should make everything pretty simple. Below
is a screenshot of the setup page (your version will probably be newer
than the version printed in this screenshot):
</p>

<p>
By default, Tor is not configured to run at startup.
<!--We highly recommend that you enable that feature, however. -->
You can enable this by checking the "Run at startup" box as shown below.
Be sure to leave the other boxes checked.
</p>

<p>Once the installer is finished, it will run Tor in a window so
you can see its logs and errors. (When you wish to browse anonymously,
you may minimize this window, but do not close it.)
</p>

<img alt="tor window screenshot"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-win32-dos-window.png" />

<p>Tor comes configured as a client by default. It uses a built-in
default configuration file, and most people won't need to change any of
the settings. Tor is now installed. Close the Tor client for now by
closing the cmd window.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Install Privoxy for Web Browsing</h2>

<p>After installing Tor, you need to configure your applications to use it.
</p>

<p>
The first step is to set up web browsing. Start by installing <a
href="http://www.privoxy.org/">Privoxy</a> (click on 'recent releases',
then scroll down to the MS Windows installer packages). Privoxy is a filtering
web proxy that integrates well with Tor. Once it's installed, it should
appear in your system tray as a "P" in a circle, as pictured below: Exit from
Privoxy for now by right clicking on the "P" icon and finding the exit option.
</p>

<img alt="privoxy icon in the system tray"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-win32-privoxy-icon.jpg" />

<p>You need to configure Privoxy to use Tor.
Open Privoxy's main config file by selecting it from Start Menu|All
Programs:
</p>

<img border="1" alt="editing privoxy config"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-win32-privoxy-config.png" />

<p>Add the line <br>
<tt>forward-socks4a / localhost:9050 .</tt><br>
to Privoxy's config file. Don't forget to add the dot at the end.
The easiest way is to select the above line and copy/paste it into
the file. Be sure to save.
</p>

<img border="1" alt="privoxy points to tor"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-win32-privoxy-edit.png" />

<p>Privoxy keeps a log file of everything passed through it.  In
order to stop this you will need to comment out two lines by inserting a
# before the line. The two lines are:<br>
<tt>logfile privoxy.log</tt><br>
and the line <br>
<tt>jarfile jar.log</tt><br>
Be sure to save. You'll need to exit and restart Privoxy for the changes
to take affect.  
</p>
<p>Instructions for restarting Privoxy:<br>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the Privoxy systray icon and choose "Exit Privoxy".
</li>
<li> Left click on Start Menu then Programs then Privoxy.  Select the
green "P" Privoxy icon.  This starts Privoxy, which should appear in your system
tray again.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2>Step Three: Configure your applications to use Tor</h2>

<p>Then change your browser to HTTP proxy at localhost port 8118.
(That's where Privoxy listens.)
In Firefox it's Tools|Options|General|Connection Settings.
In Mozilla, this is in Edit|Preferences|Advanced|Proxies.
In Opera 7.5x it's Tools|Preferences|Network|Proxy servers.
In IE, it's Tools|Internet Options|Connections|LAN Settings|Advanced.
You should also set your SSL proxy (IE calls it "Secure") to the same
thing, to hide your SSL traffic too. In IE, this looks something like:</p>

src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-win32-ie-lan.jpg" />
<img alt="Proxy settings in IE"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-win32-ie-proxies.jpg" />

<p>Using privoxy is <strong>necessary</strong> because <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">browsers
leak your
DNS requests when they use a SOCKS proxy directly</a>, which is bad for
your anonymity. Privoxy also removes certain dangerous headers from your
web requests, and blocks obnoxious ad sites like Doubleclick.</p>

<p>To test if it's working, you need to know your normal IP address so you can
verify that the address really changes when running Tor.
Go to the Start menu, click Run and enter <tt>cmd</tt>.
At the command prompt, enter <tt>ipconfig /a</tt>. If you are behind a NAT/Firewall/Router
you can use one of the sites listed below to check which IP you are using.
When that is done, clear your browser's cache, start Tor and Privoxy and visit any of the sites again.
If everything works, your IP address should have changed.
</p>

<p>
<!--<a href="http://peertech.org/privacy-knoppix/">peertech</a>, -->
<a href="http://ipid.shat.net">ipid.shat.net</a> and
<a href="http://www.showmyip.com/">showmyip.com</a>
are sites that show your current IP so you can see
what address and country you're coming from.
</p>

<p>
If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's ability
to connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from your local
applications to
local port 8118 and port 9050. If your firewall blocks outgoing connections,
punch a hole so it can connect to at least TCP ports 80, 443, and 9001-9033.

href="http://wiki.noreply.org/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ">the FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>To Torify another application that supports HTTP, just point it at Privoxy
(that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS directly (for example, for
instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), point your application directly at
Tor (localhost port 9050). For applications that support neither SOCKS
nor HTTP, take a look at <a
href="http://www.socks.permeo.com/Download/SocksCapDownload/index.asp">SocksCap</a>,
<a href="http://www.freecap.ru/eng/">FreeCap</a>,
or the <a
href="http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/socks/index.html?cks=y">Hummingbird</a>
SOCKS client. (FreeCap is free software; the others are proprietary.)<br />
