        - Not done
        * Top priority
        . Partially done
        o Done
        D Deferred
        X Abandoned


        o Use a stronger cipher
                o aes now, by including the code ourselves
        . streams / circuits
                o Implement streams
                o Rotate circuits after N minutes?
                X Circuits should expire when circuit->expire triggers
NICK            . Handle half-open connections
                        o Figure out what causes connections to close, standardize
                          when we mark a connection vs when we tear it down
                o Look at what ssl does to keep from mutating data streams
                - Reduce streamid footprint from 7 bytes to 3 bytes
                        - Check for collisions in streamid (now possible with
                          just 3 bytes), and back up & replace with padding if so
                - Use the 3 saved bytes to put pseudorandomness in each cell
                - Use the 4 reserved bytes in each cell header to keep 1/5
                  of a sha1 of the payload
                        - (Move these 4 bytes into the stream header)
                - Consider moving length into the stream header too
                - Spec the stream_id stuff. Clarify that nobody on the backward
                  stream should look at stream_id.
        X On the fly compression of each stream
        o Clean up the event loop (optimize and sanitize)
ARMA    o Remove that awful concept of 'roles'
ARMA    . Exit policies
                o Spec how to write the exit policies
                - Path selection algorithms
                        - Let user request certain nodes
                        - And disallow certain nodes
                        D Choose path by jurisdiction, etc?
                - Make relay end cells have failure status and payload attached
                - Streams that fail due to exit policy must reextend to new node

                o Distribute queries onto the farm, get answers
                o Preemptively grow a new worker before he's needed

                o DNS cache   
                        o Clear DNS cache over time  
                        D Honor DNS TTL info (how??)
                o Have strategy when all workers are busy
                o Keep track of which connections are in dns_wait
                o Need to cache positives/negatives on the tor side
                        o Keep track of which queries have been asked
                o Better error handling when

                        o We have max workers running
                o Consider taking the master out of the loop?
