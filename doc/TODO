Bugs:
        - on solaris, need to build with
          LDFLAGS="-lsocket -lnsl" ./configure --with-ssl-dir=/usr/local/ssl
        - should maybe make clients exit(1) when bad things happen?
          e.g. clock skew.
        o client-side dns cache doesn't appear to be getting populated
          by 'connected' cells. In fact, the 'connected' cells don't even
          include the IP.
        o When it can't resolve any dirservers, it is useless from then on.
          We should make it reload the RouterFile if it has no dirservers.
        o Sometimes it picks a middleman node as the exit for a circuit.
        o if you specify a non-dirserver as exitnode or entrynode, when it
          makes the first few circuits it hasn't yet fetched the directory,
          so it warns that it doesn't know the node.
        o make 'make test' exit(1) if a test fails.
        . fix buffer unit test so it passes

Short-term:
        o put IP into the descriptor, so clients don't need to resolve things
        o when you hup, rewrite the router.desc file (and maybe others)
        - consider handling broken socks4 implementations
        - improve how it behaves when i remove a line from the approved-routers files
        - Make tls connections tls_close intentionally
        - Add '[...truncated]' or similar to truncated log entries (like the directory
          in connection_dir_process_inbuf()).
        - Make logs handle it better when writing to them fails.
        - leave server descriptor out of directory if it's too old
        o Rename ACI to circID
        . integrate rep_ok functions, see what breaks
        - update tor faq
        o obey SocksBindAddress, ORBindAddress
        o warn if we're running as root
        o make connection_flush_buf() more obviously obsolete
        o let hup reread the config file, eg so we can get new exit
          policies without restarting
        o Put recommended_versions in a config entry
        X use times(2) rather than gettimeofday to measure how long it
          takes to process a cell
        o Separate trying to rebuild a circuit because you have none from trying 
          to rebuild a circuit because the current one is stale
        X Continue reading from socks port even while waiting for connect.
        o Exit policies
                o Spec how to write the exit policies
                o Path selection algorithms
                        o Choose path more incrementally
                        o Let user request first/last node
                        o And disallow certain nodes
                        D Choose path by jurisdiction, etc?
                o Make relay end cells have failure status and payload attached
        X let non-approved routers handshake.
        X Dirserver shouldn't put you in running-routers list if you haven't
          uploaded a descriptor recently
        X migrate to using nickname rather than addr:port for routers
        - migrate to using IPv6 sizes everywhere
        o Move from onions to ephemeral DH
                o incremental path building
                o transition circuit-level sendmes to hop-level sendmes
                o implement truncate, truncated
                o move from 192byte DH to 128byte DH, so it isn't so damn slow
                X exiting from not-last hop
                        X OP logic to decide to extend/truncate a path
                        X make sure exiting from the not-last hop works
                        X logic to find last *open* hop, not last hop, in cpath
        o Remember address and port when beginning. 
        - Extend by nickname/hostname/something, not by IP.
        - Need a relay teardown cell, separate from one-way ends.
        X remove per-connection rate limiting
        - Make it harder to circumvent bandwidth caps: look at number of bytes
          sent across sockets, not number sent inside TLS stream.

On-going
        . Better comments for functions!
        . Go through log messages, reduce confusing error messages.
        . make the logs include more info (fd, etc)
        . Unit tests
        . Update the spec so it matches the code

Mid-term:
        - Rotate tls-level connections -- make new ones, expire old ones.
          So we get actual key rotation, not just symmetric key rotation
        o Are there anonymity issues with sequential streamIDs? Sequential
          circIDs? Eg an attacker can learn how many there have been.
          The fix is to initialize them randomly rather than at 1.
        - Look at having smallcells and largecells
        . Redo scheduler
                o fix SSL_read bug for buffered records
                - make round-robining more fair
        - What happens when a circuit's length is 1? What breaks?
        . streams / circuits
                o Implement streams
                o Rotate circuits after N minutes?
                X Circuits should expire when circuit->expire triggers
NICK            . Handle half-open connections
                        o openssh is an application that uses half-open connections
                        o Figure out what causes connections to close, standardize
                          when we mark a connection vs when we tear it down
                o Look at what ssl does to keep from mutating data streams
        o Put CPU workers in separate processes
                o Handle multiple cpu workers (one for each cpu, plus one)
                o Queue for pending tasks if all workers full
                o Support the 'process this onion' task

                . Get socks4a support into Mozilla
        . Develop rendezvous points

                        . webload infrastructure (Bruce)
                        . httperf infrastructure (easy to set up)

                D Support IPv6 rather than just 4
                o Handle multihomed servers (config variable to set IP)

In the distant future:
        D Load balancing between router twins

Older (done) todo stuff:

For 0.0.2pre17:
        o Put a H(K | handshake) into the onionskin response
        o Make cells 512 bytes
        o Reduce streamid footprint from 7 bytes to 2 bytes
          X Check for collisions in streamid (now possible with
            just 2 bytes), and back up & replace with padding if so
        o Use the 4 reserved bytes in each cell header to keep 1/5
          of a sha1 of the ongoing relay payload (move into stream header)
        o Move length into the stream header too
        o Make length 2 bytes
        D increase DH key length
        D increase RSA key length
        D Spec the stream_id stuff. Clarify that nobody on the backward
          stream should look at stream_id.

Cell:
        ACI (anonymous circuit identifier)    [2 bytes]
        Command                               [1 byte]
        Payload (padded with 0 bytes)         [509 bytes]

Relay payload:
        Relay command           [1 byte]
        Stream ID               [7 bytes]
        Partial SHA-1           [4 bytes]
        Length                  [2 bytes]
        Relay payload           [495 bytes]

For 0.0.2pre15:
        o don't pick exit nodes which will certainly reject all things.
        o don't pick nodes that the directory says are down
        o choose randomly from running dirservers, not just first one
        o install the man page
        o warn when client-side tries an address/port which no router in the dir accepts.

For 0.0.2pre14:
        o More flexible exit policies (18.*, 18.0.0.0/8)
        o Work to succeed in the precense of exit policy violation
                o Replace desired_path_len with opaque path-selection specifier

                o Add entries to client DNS cache based on END cells
                o Remove port from END_REASON_EXITPOLICY cells
                o Start building new circuits when we get an exit-policy
                  failure.  (Defer exiting from the middle of existing
                  circuits or extending existing circuits for later.)
                o Implement function to check whether a routerinfo_t 
                  supports a given exit addr.
                o Choose the exit node of an in-progress circuit based on
                  pending AP connections.
                o Choose the exit node _first_, then beginning, then
                  middle nodes.
