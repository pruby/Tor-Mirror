Short-term:
NICK    . routers have identity key, link key, onion key.
                - link key certs are signed by identity key
                  - not in descriptor
                  - not in config
                  - not on disk
                - identity and onion keys are in descriptor (and disk?)
NICK    - upon boot, if it doesn't find identity key, generate it and write it.
NICK    - also write a file with the identity key fingerprint in it
NICK    - router generates descriptor: flesh out router_get_my_descriptor()
          - figure out what directory generation stuff can be moved out of main.c
NICK    - Routers sign descriptors with identity key
NICK    - routers put version number in descriptor
NICK    - routers should maybe have `uname -a` in descriptor?
NICK    . Give nicknames to routers
                o in config
                - in descriptors
ARMA    - router posts descriptor
                - when it boots
                - when it changes
NICK    - change tls stuff so certs don't get written to disk, or read from disk
        o make directory.c 'thread'safe
NICK    ? dirserver parses descriptor
        - dirserver checks signature
        D client checks signature?
NICK    - dirserver writes directory to file
          - reads that file upon boot
NICK    - directory includes all routers, up and down
NICK    - add "up" line to directory, listing nicknames
ARMA    - find an application that uses half-open connections, to test
NICK    - instruments ORs to report stats
          - average cell fullness
          - average bandwidth used
          - others?
        . integrate rep_ok functions, see what breaks
ARMA    - configure log files. separate log file, separate severities.
ARMA    - what assumptions break if we fclose(0) when we daemonize?
NICK    - make buffer struct elements opaque outside buffers.c
ARMA    - Go through log messages, reduce confusing error messages.
ARMA    - make the logs include more info (fd, etc)
ARMA    - add log convention to the HACKING file
        - make 'make install' do the right thing
        o change binary name to tor
        o change config files so you look at commandline, else look in
          /etc/torrc. no cascading.
ARMA    - have an absolute datadir with fixed names for files, and fixed-name
          keydir under that with fixed names
ARMA    - tor faq
          list all other systems, why we're different.

Mid-term:
        - What happens when a circuit's length is 1? What breaks?
        . streams / circuits
                o Implement streams
                o Rotate circuits after N minutes?
                X Circuits should expire when circuit->expire triggers
NICK            . Handle half-open connections
                        o Figure out what causes connections to close, standardize
                          when we mark a connection vs when we tear it down
                o Look at what ssl does to keep from mutating data streams
ARMA    - Reduce streamid footprint from 7 bytes to 2 bytes
                - Check for collisions in streamid (now possible with
                  just 2 bytes), and back up & replace with padding if so
                - Use the 3 saved bytes to put pseudorandomness in each relay cell
                - Use the 4 reserved bytes in each cell header to keep 1/5
                  of a sha1 of the relay payload (move into stream header)
                - Move length into the stream header too
                - Spec the stream_id stuff. Clarify that nobody on the backward
                  stream should look at stream_id.

                        D Choose path by jurisdiction, etc?
                - Make relay end cells have failure status and payload attached
                - Streams that fail due to exit policy must reextend to new node
                - Add extend_wait state to edge connections, thumb through them
                  when the AP get an extended cell.
