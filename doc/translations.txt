##      Instructions for helping translate text for Vidalia, TorButton
##      and TorCheck
##  ( More translation information for Tor related apps will accumulate here )

Our translations are handled in one of two places. The Tor Translation Portal
handles all of the translations for Vidalia, Torbutton and TorCheck. The Tor
website itself is currently handled by hand translations using subversion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the Tor website, you'll need a Tor SVN account.
If you do not have one and you need one, please run this command with your
desired username in place of 'USERNAME':
    htdigest -c passwd.tmp "Tor subversion repository" USERNAME
and send us the contents of passwd.tmp.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the Portal-based projects, all three check in their respective .po
files into the following subversion urls:

    https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/translation/trunk/projects/torbutton
    https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/translation/trunk/projects/torcheck
    https://svn.vidalia-project.net/svn/vidalia/trunk/src/vidalia/i18n/

The current pootle configuration is checked into subversion as well:

    https://tor-svn.freehaven.net/svn/translation/trunk/pootle

---------------------------- TorCheck -------------------------------

TorCheck uses our translation portal to accept translations. Users use
the portal to check in their changes.  To make use of the translations
that users have commited to the translations/ subversion module, you'll
need to ensure that you have a current checked out copy of TorCheck:

    cd check/trunk/i18n/
    check/trunk/i18n$ svn up

You should see something like the following:

    Fetching external item into 'pootle'
    External at revision 15300.

    At revision 15300.

Now if you had changes, you'd simply want to move the newly updated .po files
into the current stable directory.  Moving the .po files from
'check/trunk/i18n/pootle/' into 'check/trunk/i18n' properly naming the files
for their respective locale.

Here's an example of how to move all of the current pootle translations into
the svn trunk area of TorCheck:

    cd check/trunk/i18n/
    for locale in `ls -1 pootle/|grep -v template`;
    do
    mv -v pootle/$locale/TorCheck_$locale.po TorCheck_$locale.po;
    done

Now check the differences (ensure the output looks reasonable):

    svn diff

Ensure that msgfmt has no errors:

    msgfmt -C *.po

And finally check in the changes:

    svn commit

---------------------------- Torbutton -------------------------------

Torbutton uses our translation portal to accept translations. Users use
the portal to check in their changes.

To make use of the translations that users have commited to the translations/
subversion module, you'll need to ensure that you have a current checked out
copy of Torbutton:

    cd torbutton/trans_tools
    torbutton/trans_tools$ svn up

You should see something like the following:

    Fetching external item into 'pootle'
    External at revision 15300.

    At revision 15300.

Now if you had changes, you need to convert from .po and move
the newly updated mozilla files into the current stable locale
directory. First convert them with the 'mkmoz.sh' script and then
move the proper mozilla files from 'torbutton/trans_tools/moz/' into
'torbutton/src/chrome/locale/' directory while properly naming the files
for their respective locale.

Here's an example of how to move all of the current pootle translations into
the svn trunk area of Torbutton:

    cd torbutton/trans_tools
    ./mkmoz.sh
    for locale in `ls -1 moz/`;
    do
       mv -v moz/$locale/*.{dtd,properties} ../src/chrome/locale/$locale/;
    done

Now check the differences (ensure the output looks reasonable):

    svn diff

And finally check in the changes:

    svn commit


If you make changes to strings in Torbutton, you need to rebuild the 
templates in torbutton/trans_tools/pootle/templates. This is done via:

    moz2po -P -i torbutton/src/chrome/locale/en/ -o torbutton/trans_tools/templates/

You now have two options:

Option 1 (The Pootle Web UI Way):

View then commit the changes to the template with:

    svn diff torbutton/trans_tools/templates/ 
    svn commit torbutton/trans_tools/templates/

Then poke Jake to 'svn up' on the Pootle side. If you do this enough
times, he may give you a button to click to update templates in Pootle,
or maybe even an account on the Pootle server. Persistence is a virtue.

You then need to go to the Pootle website and click the checkbox next to
every language on:
https://translation.torproject.org/projects/torbutton/admin.html
and then click "Update Languages" at the bottom.

You then need to go to each language and go to "Editing Options" and click 
"Commit" for each one. 

You then need to 'svn up' locally, and follow the procedure above for
rebuilding your .dtd and .properties files.

Yes, this sucks. :/

Option 2 (Use your own msgmerge: YMMV, may change .po flags and formatting):

Run msgmerge yourself for each language:

    cd torbutton/trans_tools
    for i in `ls -1 pootle`
    do
       msgmerge -U ./pootle/$i/torbutton.dtd.po ./pootle/templates/torbutton.dtd.pot
       msgmerge -U ./pootle/$i/torbutton.properties.po ./pootle/templates/torbutton.properties.pot
    done
    svn diff pootle
    svn commit pootle

Then poke Jake to 'svn up' on the Pootle side. If you do this enough times, 
he may give you a button on Pootle, or maybe even an account on the Pootle 
server. Persistence is a virtue.

You may notice that some .po file flags and string formatting have changed 
with this method, depending on your gettext version. It is unclear if this 
is a problem. Please update this doc if you hit a landmine and everything 
breaks :)

After this process is done, you then need to regenerate the mozilla
.dtd and .properties files as specified above.

---------------------------- Vidalia -------------------------------

Vidalia uses our translation portal to accept translations. Users use the
portal to check in their changes. No conversion or moving is required other
than normal pootle usage.
