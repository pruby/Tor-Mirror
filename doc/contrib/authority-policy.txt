Here's a first set of guidelines for how to pick new directory
authorities.

(These won't be formal criteria -- we need to keep this loose since
we're making it up as we go.)

o Stability:
  - Must be a low-downtime Tor server (computer as well as network).
  - Must have a static IP.
  - The operator must have been running a stable Tor server for at least
    3 months.
  - Must intend for this server to stick around for the next 12 months
    or more.
  - Must not hibernate.
  - Should not be an exit node (as this increases the risk both of
    downtime and of key compromise).

o Performance:
  - Must have sufficient bandwidth: at least 300 kB/s symmetric,
    though in practice the inbound traffic can be considerably less.

o Availability:
  - Must be available to upgrade within a few days in most cases.
    (While we're still developing Tor, we periodically find bugs that
    impact the whole network and require dirserver upgrades.)

o Integrity:
  - Must promise not to censor or attack the network and users.
  - Should be run by somebody that Tor (i.e. Roger) knows.
  - Should be widely regarded as fair/trustworthy, or at least
    known, by many people.
  - If somebody asks you to backdoor or change your server, legally or
    otherwise, you will fight it to the extent of your abilities. If
    you fail to fight it, you must shut down the Tor server and notify
    us that you have.
  - Dirservers (and operators) in a variety of jurisdictions are best.
