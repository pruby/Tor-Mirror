The following steps are the exact steps used to produce the "official"
OSX builds of tor

Summary:
1) Compile and install a static version of the latest release of
libevent.
2) Acquire privoxyosx_setup_3.0.3.zip.  Remember where you put this
file.
3) Acquire and install your preferred version of tor via "make
dist-osx"

Details:
### Compiling libevent

1)  Download the latest libevent from
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

2) The first step of compiling libevent is to configure it as
follows:
       ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared

3) Complete the "make" and "make install".  You will need to be root,
or sudo -s, to complete the "make install".

4) If you have previouslly installed libevent, go rm the old libevent.so*
files so the linker doesn't get suckered into using them.


### Acquiring privoxy

1) Download osx privoxy source from
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ijbswa/privoxyosx_setup_3.0.3.zip?download

2) Edit /path/to/tor/contrib/osx/package.sh and confirm
PRIVOXY_PKG_ZIP= is set to the correct path to find the
file privoxyosx_setup_3.0.3.zip


## Compiling Tor

1) Get your preferred version of the tor source from tor.eff.org.

2) In the top level, this means /path/to/tor/, not tor/contrib/osx,
do a configure with these parameters:
     configure --prefix=/Library/Tor --bindir=/Library/Tor \
     --sysconfdir=/Library --enable-static --disable-shared

3) In same top level dir, do a "make dist-osx".  There now exists a
.dmg file in the same directory.  Install from this dmg.

## Universal Binaries for OSX PPC and X86

\ LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk" \
       ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared \
       --disable-dependency-tracking

3) Complete the "make" and "make install".  You will need to be root,
or sudo -s, to complete the "make install".

4) If you have previouslly installed libevent, go rm the old libevent.so*
