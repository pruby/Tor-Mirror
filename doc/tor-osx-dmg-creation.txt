## Instructions for building the official dmgs for OSX.
##

The following steps are the exact steps used to produce the "official"
OSX builds of tor.

Summary:
1) Compile and install a static version of the latest release of
libevent.
2) Acquire privoxyosx_setup_3.0.6.zip.  
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ijbswa/privoxyosx_setup_3.0.6.zip?modtime=1164104652&big_mirror=0
  Remember where you put this file.
3) Acquire torbutton xpi and license file.
4) Acquire and install your preferred version of tor. Extract.
5) Update some variables in contrib/osx/package.sh
6) "make dist-osx"
7) You now have a dmg from which you can install Tor, Privoxy, and the
Torbutton extension for Firefox.

## Universal Binaries for OSX PPC and X86
## This method works in OSX 10.4 (Tiger) and 10.5 (Leopard) only.
## See far below if you don't care about cross compiling for PPC and X86.
## The single architecture process starts with "###"

1) Install XCode 2.4.1 updates available from http://developer.apple.com.

## Compiling libevent

2)  Download latest libevent from
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

3) The first step of compiling libevent is to configure it as
follows:
CFLAGS="-O -g -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk" \
./configure --enable-static --disable-shared --disable-dependency-tracking

3) Complete the "make" and "make install".  You will need to be root,
or sudo -s, to complete the "make install".

4) If you have previouslly installed libevent, rm the old libevent.*, located
by default, in /usr/local/lib/.  

5) Check for a successful universal binary of libevent.a in, by default,
/usr/local/lib by using the following command:
	"file /usr/local/lib/libevent.a"

	Your output should be:
/usr/local/lib/libevent.a: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
/usr/local/lib/libevent.a (for architecture i386):      current ar archive random library
/usr/local/lib/libevent.a (for architecture ppc):       current ar archive

## Acquiring privoxy

6) Download osx privoxy source from
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ijbswa/privoxyosx_setup_3.0.6.zip?modtime=1164104652&big_mirror=0

7) Place the privoxyosx_setup_3.0.6.zip in a location of your choice.
Remember this location.

8) Get your preferred version of Torbutton from https://torbutton.torproject.org.
Place into a location of your choosing, remember this location.

9) Get the torbutton LICENSE file from https://torbutton.torproject.org.
Place into a location of your choosing, remember this location.

10) Get your preferred version of the tor source from https://www.torproject.org/download.  
Extract the tarball.

11) Update three variables in contrib/osx/package.sh:
PRIVOXY_PKG_ZIP=~/tmp/privoxyosx_setup_3.0.6.zip
TORBUTTON_PATH=~/tmp/torbutton-1.1.18-alpha.xpi
TORBUTTON_LIC_PATH=~/tmp/LICENSE

Make sure the paths are correct.  The build will fail if they are not.

12) In the top level, this means /path/to/tor/, not tor/contrib/osx,
do a configure with these parameters:
CFLAGS="-O -g -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk -arch i386 -arch ppc" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-syslibroot,/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk" \
CONFDIR=/Library/Tor \
./configure --prefix=/Library/Tor --bindir=/Library/Tor \
--sysconfdir=/Library --disable-dependency-tracking

13) "make dist-osx"

14) Confirm you have created a universal binary by issuing the follow command:
"file src/or/tor".  Its output should be as follows:
src/or/tor: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
src/or/tor (for architecture i386):     Mach-O executable i386
src/or/tor (for architecture ppc):      Mach-O executable ppc

15) There should exist in the top-level directory a
Tor-$VERSION-universal-$OS-Bundle.dmg

16) Congrats.  You have a universal binary. You are now ready to install Tor,
Privoxy, and the Torbutton extension for Firefox.


### Single Architecture Binaries for PPC or X86, not both.
### This method works in all versions of OSX 10.1 through 10.5

### Compiling libevent

1)  Download the latest libevent from
http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/

2) The first step of compiling libevent is to configure it as
follows:
       ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared

3) Complete the "make" and "make install".  You will need to be root,
or sudo -s, to complete the "make install".

4) If you have previouslly installed libevent, go rm the old libevent.so*
files so the linker doesn't get suckered into using them.

### Acquiring privoxy

1) Download osx privoxy source from
http://downloads.sourceforge.net/ijbswa/privoxyosx_setup_3.0.6.zip?modtime=1164104652&big_mirror=0

2) Place the privoxyosx_setup_3.0.6.zip in a location of your choice.
Remember this location.

### Compiling Tor

1) Get your preferred version of Torbutton from
https://torbutton.torproject.org.  
Place into a location of your choosing, remember this location.

2) Get the torbutton LICENSE file from https://torbutton.torproject.org.  
Place into a location of your choosing, remember this location.

3) Get your preferred version of the tor source from https://www.torproject.org.  Extract the
tarball.

4) Update three variables in contrib/osx/package.sh:
PRIVOXY_PKG_ZIP=~/tmp/privoxyosx_setup_3.0.6.zip
TORBUTTON_PATH=~/tmp/torbutton-1.1.18-alpha.xpi
TORBUTTON_LIC_PATH=~/tmp/LICENSE

Make sure the paths are correct.  The build will fail if they are not.

5) In the top level, this means /path/to/tor/, not tor/contrib/osx,
do a configure with these parameters:
     CONFDIR=/Library/Tor ./configure --prefix=/Library/Tor \
     --bindir=/Library/Tor --sysconfdir=/Library

6) In same top level dir, do a "make dist-osx".  There now exists a
.dmg file in the same directory.  Install from this dmg.
