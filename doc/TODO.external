=======================================================================

External constraints:

  - mid July
W   - Take the results from instrumenting directory downloads on Tor
      clients, and analyze/simulate some alternate approaches. Finish
      proposal for how to improve things, iterate based on feedback,
      convince us that the anonymity tradeoffs and/or scalability
      tradeoffs are acceptable.

  - mid August
KS  - Design hidden service improvements, evaluate them and consider
      security properties: write some proposals, get feedback, revise
      them, etc.
?   - nlnet 'user safety contest'. submit torbrowser, others?

  - end of August
I   - Auto update
      o Vidalia learns when Tor thinks it should be updated
R     - Tor status events should suggest a new version to switch to
I     - Figure out a good PKI, document the design, assess security issues:
        "write a proposal"
      - Vidalia fetches the new one via Tor when possible, but fetches
        it without Tor "when necessary", whatever that means.
        - Give an interface for notifying the user, and letting her
          decide to fetch and decide to swap out the old Tor for the new.
      - Do the same for Polipo
      - and for Vidalia itself

  - end of September
NSE - Write first draft of research study for Paul's research problem.
      This should be at least vaguely related to what was discussed in
      the end-of-May deliverable.

  - mid October
KS  - Finish implementation of hidden service improvements: have a set
      of patches that you think work.
W   - Finish implementation of directory overhead changes: have a set
      of patches that you think work.

  - mid January
KS  - Finish testing, debugging, unit testing, etc the hidden service
      changes. Have it in the development version and in use.
W   - Finish testing, debugging, unit testing, etc the directory overhead
      changes. Have it in the development version and in use.
