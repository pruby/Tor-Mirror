1. Overview

  Proposal 125 introduced the basic notion of how bridge authorities,
  bridge relays, and bridge users should behave. But it doesn't get into
  the various mechanisms of how to distribute bridge relay addresses to
  bridge users.

  One of the mechanisms we have in mind is called 'families of bridges'.
  If a bridge user knows about only one private bridge, and that bridge
  shuts off for the night or gets a new dynamic IP address, the bridge
  user is out of luck and needs to re-bootstrap manually or wait and
  hope it comes back. On the other hand, if the bridge user knows about
  a family of bridges, then as long as one of those bridges is still
  reachable his Tor client can automatically  learn about where the
  other bridges have gone.

  So in this design, a single volunteer could run multiple coordinated
  bridges, or a group of volunteers could each run a bridge. We abstract
  out the details of how these volunteers find each other and decide to
  set up a family.


somebody needs to run a bridge authority

it needs to have a torrc option to publish networkstatuses of its bridges

it should also do reachability testing just of those bridges

people ask for the bridge networkstatus by asking for a url that
contains a password. (it's safe to do this because of begin_dir.)

so the bridge users need to know a) a password, and b) a bridge
authority line.

the bridge users need to know the bridge authority line.

the bridge authority needs to know the password.
