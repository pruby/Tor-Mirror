1. Scanning process
   A. Non-HTML/JS mime types compared via SHA1 hash
   B. Dynamic content filtered at 4 levels:
      1. IP change+Tor cookie utilization
         - Tor cookies replayed with new IP in case of changes
      2. HTML Tag+Attribute+JS comparison
         - Comparisons made based only on "relevant" HTML tags
           and attributes 
      3. HTML Tag+Attribute+JS diffing
         - Tags, attributes and JS AST nodes that change during
           Non-Tor fetches pruned from comparison
      4. URLS with > N% of node failures removed
         - results purged from filesystem at end of scan loop
   C. Scanner can be restarted from any point in the event
      of scanner or system crashes, or graceful shutdown.
      - Results+scan state pickled to filesystem continuously
2. Cron job checks results periodically for reporting
   A. Divide failures into three types of BadExit based on type
      and frequency over time and incident rate
   B. write reject lines to approved-routers for those three types:
      1. ID Hex based (for misconfig/network problems easily fixed)
      2. IP based (for content modification)
      3. IP+mask based (for continuous/eggregious content modification)
   C. Emails results to tor-scanners@freehaven.net
3. Human Review and Appeal
   A. ID Hex-based BadExit is meant to be possible to removed easily
      without needing to beg us.
      - Should this behavior be encouraged? 
   B. Optionally can reserve IP based badexits for human review
      1. Results are encapsulated fully on the filesystem and can be
         reviewed without network access
      2. Soat has --rescan to rescan failed nodes from a data directory
         - New set of URLs used
