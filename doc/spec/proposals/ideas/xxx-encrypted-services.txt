the basic idea might be to generate a keypair, and sign little statements
like "this key corresponds to this relay id", and publish them on karsten's
hs dht.

so if you want to talk to it, you look it up, then go to that exit.
and by 'go to' i mean 'build a tor circuit like normal except you're sure
where to exit'

connecting to it is slower than usual, but once you're connected, it's no
slower than normal tor.
and you get what wikileaks wants from its hidden service, which is really
just the UI piece.
indymedia also wants this.

might be interesting to let an encrypted service list more than one relay,
too.
