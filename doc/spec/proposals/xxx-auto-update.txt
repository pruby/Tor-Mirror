Notes on an auto updater:

steve wants a "latest" symlink so he can always just fetch that.

roger worries that this will exacerbate the "what version are you
using?" "latest." problem.

weasel suggests putting the latest recommended version in dns. then
we don't have to hit the website. it's got caching, it's lightweight,
it scales. just put it in a TXT record or something.

but, no dnssec.

roger suggests a file on the https website that lists the latest
recommended version (or filename or url or something like that).

(steve seems to already be doing this with xerobank. he additionally
suggests a little blurb that can be displayed to the user to describe
what's new.)

how to verify you're getting the right file?
a) it's https.
b) ship with a signing key, and use some openssl functions to verify.
c) both

andrew reminds us that we have a "recommended versions" line in the
consensus directory already.

if only we had some way to point out the "latest stable recommendation"
from this list. we could list it first, or something.

the recommended versions line also doesn't take into account which
packages are available -- e.g. on Windows one version might be the best
available, and on OS X it might be a different one.

aren't there existing solutions to this? surely there is a beautiful,
efficient, crypto-correct auto updater lib out there. even for windows.
