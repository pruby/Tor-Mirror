Overview

   Right now, Tor user can manually exclude a node of all the part of
   circuits created using the directive ExcludeNodes.  
   This proposal makes this exclusion, less restrictive, allowing to 
   exclude a node only on the exit part of a circuit.

Motivation

   Helping the integration into vidalia (tor exit branch)or other tools,
   of features to exclude a country for exit without reducing 
   circuits possibilities, an privacy.
   This feature could help people from a country were many sites 
   are blocked to exclude this country for browsing, giving them a 
   more stable navigation.
   Add the possibility for the user to exclude the current used exit
   node. 
   
   
Implementation

   ExcludeExitNodes is similar to ExcludeNodes except it's only
   the exit node which is excluded for circuit build.
   
   Tor doesn't warn if node from this list is not an exit node.

Security implications:

   Open also possibilities for a future user bad exit reporting.
