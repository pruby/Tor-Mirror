<h1>Installing SwitchProxy for <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a></h1>

<p>
SwitchProxy is a Firefox plugin that makes it easy for you to switch
between using a proxy and connecting to websites directly.</p>

<p>In this howto, you're going to set up SwitchProxy to let you change
between using Privoxy and a direct connection. We assume you already
have Firefox installed and working.</p>

<h3>Step Zero: Download and Install Tor and Privoxy</h3>

<p>Before you start, you need to do <a
href="http://tor.eff.org/doc/tor-doc-win32.html#installing">step one</a>
and <a href="http://tor.eff.org/doc/tor-doc-win32.html#privoxy">step
two</a> of the Tor installation howto. When you're done, Tor will be up
and running, Privoxy will be up and running, and Privoxy will be configured
to point to Tor.</p>

<h3>Step One: Download and Install SwitchProxy</h3>

<p>SwitchProxy is a Firefox plugin, so you need to go through
the process of installing a new plugin. First, go to the <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&id=125">
SwitchProxy</a> web page. It looks like this -- click on the "Install
Now" button.</p>

<p>It will pop up a window asking for permission to install the plugin.
Click on "Install Now":
</p>

<p>Once the installer is finished, it will tell you that you SwitchProxy
will be working once you restart Firefox:</p>

<h3>Step Two: Configure SwitchProxy</h3>

<p>Now restart your Firefox. You'll notice there's now a new toolbar
that lets you control your proxies. Now we're going to set up a proxy
configuration for Privoxy. Click on "add":</p>

<img alt="new toolbar"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-switchproxy-toolbar.jpg" />

<p>It will ask to select a proxy type. Choose "Standard." (There's also
an "anonymous" proxy type that uses an ad hoc set of anonymous proxies
out there. You don't want this -- Tor is better.)</p>

<img alt="standard proxy"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-switchproxy-proxytype.jpg" />

<p>Now it will show you the standard proxy config window for Firefox.
Give this configuration a proxy label of "tor". Then fill in "localhost"
and "8118" for the first two entries, as shown here. Then click "OK":</p>

<p>Now you've created the "tor" proxy label, but you're not using it yet.
Click on the pull-down list and select tor, as shown here:</p>

<p>Almost done. It may look like you're using Tor now, but you need to
click "Apply" to make your change take effect:</p>

<p>Done! Firefox will reload your current page. In this example screenshot,
it reloaded google.com and happened to get a German exit node:</p>
