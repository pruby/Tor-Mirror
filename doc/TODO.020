(Remember to include both the revision number _AND_ an abbreviated
description of the patch.)

Backport for 0.2.0:
  - r16915,r16916: Don't fail hidden service request if the descriptor
            fetch fails for one descriptor version, when the other might
            still succeed. (Will be more problematic if not backported
            as soon as services stop publishing version 0 descriptors.)
  - r16808,r16810,r16817,r16818,r16939: Don't send tunneled hidden service
            directory requests to routers for which we don't have a
            router descriptor. (Will significantly improve reliability.)
  - r17135: ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses not consistently obeyed.

Backport for 0.2.0 once better tested:
  o r16136: prevent circid collision.  [Also backport to 0.1.2.x??]

  - r16558: Avoid mis-routing CREATED cells.
  - r16621: Make some DNS code more robust (partial; see also libevent
            approach). (Also maybe r16674)
  - r17091: distinguish "no routers support pending circuits" from
            "no circuits are pending."
  - r17137: send END cell in response to connect to nonexistent hidserv port.
  - r17138: reject *:* servers should never do DNS lookups.
  - r17139: Fix another case of overriding .exit choices.
  - r17162: fix another case of not checking cpath_layer.
