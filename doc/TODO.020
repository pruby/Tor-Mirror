Backport for 0.2.0:
   - r17891: Fix a fun OpenBSD warning.
   - r17892: Fix another fun OpenBSD warning.

Backport for 0.2.0 once better tested:
  Xo r16621: Make some DNS code more robust (partial; see also libevent
            approach). (Also maybe r16674)
    [Partially backported.  Instead of the basic name checking, I backported
     r17171 instead, to be even more resistant to poisoning.]
  - r17208,r17209,r7211,r17212,r17214: Avoid gotterdammerung when an
    authority has an expired certificate.
  - r17886:  Don't remove routerinfos as unlisted unless we have a
    consensus.
  - r17887:  Don't accept 1.2.3 as a valid IP address.

Backport for 0.2.0, maybe:
