description of the patch.)

Backport items for 0.2.0:
  X r14247: tor-spec and dir-spec updates [just backport the whole files]

Backport for 0.2.0 once better tested:
  d r14830: disable openssl compression.
  o r15699,15700: react quickly to readiness of rendezvous circuits.
  o r15821: fix bug related to TLS session negotiation.
  o r16136: prevent circid collision.  [Also backport to 0.1.2.x??]
  o r16143: generate stream close events from connection_edge_destroy().
  o r16450: open /dev/pf before dropping privileges.
  o r16605: relays reject risky extend cells.
  o r16698: don't use a new entry guard that's also your exit.

  - r16558: Avoid mis-routing CREATED cells.
  - r16621: Make some DNS code more robust (partial; see also libevent
            approach). (Also maybe r16674)
  - r16915,r16916: Don't fail hidden service request if the descriptor
            fetch fails for one descriptor version, when the other might
            still succeed. (Will be more problematic if not backported
            as soon as services stop publishing version 0 descriptors.)
  - r16808,r16810,r16817,r16818,r16939: Don't send tunneled hidden service
            directory requests to routers for which we don't have a
            router descriptor. (Will significantly improve reliability.)
