<h1>Running the <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a> client on Mac OS X</h1>

<a name="installing"></a>
<h2>Step One: Download and Install Tor</h2>
<p>
<b>Note that these are the installation instructions for running a client on
  Mac OS X. If you want to run a server (please do), read the "Configuring a
  server" section at <a href="tor-doc.html#server">tor-doc.html</a>.</b>
</p>
<p>
This document was updated $Date$.
</p>
<p>
The latest beta release of Tor for Macintosh OS X is <a
href="http://tor.eff.org/dist/osx/Tor 0.1.1.2-alpha Bundle.dmg">0.1.1.2-alpha</a>.
Download it by clicking the link. You may be able to find experimental versions
<a href="http://tor.freehaven.net/dist/osx/">here</a>, if you're looking for
new features and new bugs.
</p>

<p>Our Tor installer should make everything pretty simple. Below is a
screenshot of the setup page (your version will probably be newer than
the version printed in this screenshot):
</p>

<p>
By default, Tor is configured to run at startup.  If you do not want Tor to
run on startup, you can disable this by selecting "Customize" in the
Installer, and then un-checking the "Tor Startup Script" box. Be sure to
leave the other boxes checked.
</p>

<p>Once the installer is finished and your computer restarts, Tor will
start automatically.  Tor comes configured as a client by default. It
uses a built-in default configuration file in <tt>/Library/Tor/torrc</tt>,
but most people won't need to change any of the settings. Tor is now
installed.</p>

<p>Privoxy is installed as part of the Tor bundle package
installer. Privoxy is a filtering web proxy that integrates well with
Tor. Once it's installed, it will start automatically when your computer
is restarted.
</p>

<p>You do not need to configure Privoxy to use Tor. A custom Privoxy
configuration for Tor has been installed as part of the installer package.
</p>

<h2>Step Two: Configure your applications to use Tor</h2>

<p>After installing Tor and Privoxy, you need to configure your
applications to use them. The first step is to set up web browsing.</p>

<p>If you're using Firefox (we recommend it), check out our <a
href="tor-switchproxy.html">Tor SwitchProxy howto</a> to set up
a plugin that makes it easy to switch between using Tor and using a
direct connection.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you need to manually configure your browser to HTTP proxy
at localhost port 8118.
(That's where Privoxy listens.)
In Mozilla, this is in Mozilla|Preferences|Advanced|Proxies.
You should set both your Web Proxy (HTTP) and your Secure Web Proxy
(HTTPS or SSL) to localhost port 8118, to hide your SSL traffic too.
You should consider configuring your "FTP Proxy" too; see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FtpProxy">this
note</a> about Tor and ftp proxies.
</p>

<p>If you want to use Tor with Safari, you need to change your
Network Settings. The process looks something like:</p>

<img alt="Network settings"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-osx-choose-network.png"
border="1">

<p>
Select your Network Preferences from the Apple | Location menu.</p>

<img alt="Network preferences"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-osx-choose-interface.png"
border="1">
<P>

<p>Select the Network Interface you want to enable Tor on. If you use
more than one Interface you must change the proxy settings for each
individually.</p>

<img alt="Proxy settings"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-osx-proxy-settings.png"
border="1">

<p>Select and enter 127.0.0.1 and port 8118 for both
Web Proxy (HTTP) and your Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS).
You should consider clicking on "FTP Proxy" too; see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FtpProxy">this
note</a> about Tor and ftp proxies. Leave your Use Passive FTP Mode
(PASV) setting as is.</p>

<p>Using privoxy is <strong>necessary</strong> because <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">browsers
leak your
DNS requests when they use a SOCKS proxy directly</a>, which is bad for
your anonymity. Privoxy also removes certain dangerous headers from your
web requests, and blocks obnoxious ad sites like Doubleclick.</p>

<p>To Torify other applications that support HTTP proxies, just
point them at Privoxy (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS
directly (for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc), you can point
your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050), but see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#SOCKSAndDNS">this
FAQ entry</a> for why this may be dangerous. For applications
that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at <a
href="http://www.taiyo.co.jp/~gotoh/ssh/connect.html">connect</a> or
<a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>.</p>

<a href="http://wiki.noreply.org/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorifyHOWTO">Torify
HOWTO</a>.

<h2>Step Three: Make sure it's working</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://ipid.shat.net">ipid.shat.net</a> and
<a href="http://www.showmyip.com/">showmyip.com</a>
are sites that show what IP address and country you appear to be coming
from.
</p>

<p>If you don't know your current public IP address, this may not be a
very useful test. To learn your IP address, run "<tt>ifconfig</tt>".
If you are behind a NAT or firewall, though, you won't be able
to learn your public IP address. In this case, you should 1) configure
your browser to connect directly (that is, stop using Privoxy), 2) check
your IP address with one of the sites above, 3) point your browser back
to Privoxy, and 4) see whether your IP address has changed.
</p>

<p>If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's
ability to connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from
your local applications to local port 8118 and port 9050. If
your firewall blocks outgoing connections, punch a hole so
it can connect to at least TCP ports 80 and 443, and then see <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#FirewalledClient">this
FAQ entry</a>.
</p>

<p>If it's still not working, look at <a
href="http://wiki.noreply.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#ItDoesntWork">this
FAQ entry</a> for hints.</p>

<a name="uninstall"></a>
<h2>How To Uninstall Tor and Privoxy</h2>

<p>The Tor 0.1.0.x series does not come with an uninstaller; this feature
  will be added in the 0.1.1.x series.  If you want to remove Tor on OSX,
  here's how:</p>

<p>Change your application proxy settings back to their original values.
   If you just want to stop using Tor, you can end at this point.</p>

<p>To stop Tor and Privoxy from running on startup</b>, remove the
   /Library/StartupItems/Tor and /Library/StartupItems/Privoxy directories
   respectively. If you just want to stop Tor from running, you can end at this
   point.</p>

<p>To erase all remaining Tor and Privoxy files from your computer, delete
  the following:
   <ul>
   <li>/Library/Tor</li>
   <li>/Library/Privoxy</li>
   <li>/usr/bin/tor</li>
   <li>/usr/bin/tor_resolve</li>
   <li>/var/log/tor</li>
   <li>/usr/share/man/man1/tor.1</li>
   <li>/usr/share/man/man1/tor-resolve.1</li>
   <li>/usr/share/man/man1/torify.1</li>
  </ul>
