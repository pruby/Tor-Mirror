<h1>Running the <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">Tor</a> client on Mac OS X</h1>

<a name="installing"></a>
<h2>Step One: Download and Install Tor</h2>
<p>
<b>Note that these are the installation instructions for running a client on
  Mac OS X. If you want to run a server (please do), read the "Configuring a
  server" section at <a href="tor-doc.html#server">tor-doc.html</a>.</b>
</p>
<p>
This document was updated May 17 2005.
</p>
<p>
The latest beta release of Tor for Macintosh OS X is <a
href="http://tor.eff.org/dist/osx/Tor 0.1.0.7-rc Bundle.dmg">0.1.0.7-rc</a>.
Download it by clicking the link. You may be able to find experimental versions
<a href="http://tor.freehaven.net/dist/osx/">here</a>, if you're looking for
new features and new bugs.
</p>

<p>Our Tor installer should make everything pretty simple. Below is a
screenshot of the setup page (your version will probably be newer than
the version printed in this screenshot):
</p>

<p>
By default, Tor is configured to run at startup.  If you do not want Tor to
run on startup, you can disable this by selecting "Customize" in the
Installer, and then un-checking the "Tor Startup Script" box. Be sure to
leave the other boxes checked.
</p>

<p>Once the installer is finished and your computer restarts, Tor will
start automatically.  Tor comes configured as a client by default. It
uses a built-in default configuration file in <tt>/Library/Tor/torrc</tt>,
but most people won't need to change any of the settings. Tor is now
installed.</p>

<p>Privoxy is installed as part of the Tor bundle package
installer. Privoxy is a filtering web proxy that integrates well with
Tor. Once it's installed, it will start automatically when your computer
is restarted.
</p>

<p>You do not need to configure Privoxy to use Tor. A custom Privoxy
configuration for Tor has been installed as part of the installer package.

<h2>Step Two: Configure your applications to use Tor</h2>

<p>After installing Tor, you need to configure your applications to use
it. The first step is to set up web browsing.
Change your browser to HTTP proxy at localhost port 8118.
(That's where Privoxy listens.)
In Mozilla, this is in Mozilla|Preferences|Advanced|Proxies.
In Firefox it's Firefox|Preferences|General|ConnectionSettings.
You should set both your Web Proxy (HTTP) and your Secure Web Proxy
(HTTPS or SSL) to localhost port 8118, to hide your SSL traffic too.

<p>If you want to use Tor with Safari, you need to change your
Network Settings. The process looks something like:</p>

<img alt="LAN settings in IE"

<p>
Select your Network Preferences from the Apple | Location menu.</p>

<img alt="Proxy settings in IE"

border="1">
<P>

<p>Select the Network Interface you want to enable Tor on. If you use
more than one Interface you must change the proxy settings for each
individually.</p>

<img alt="Proxy settings in IE"
src="http://tor.eff.org/img/screenshot-osx-proxy-settings.png"
border="1">

<p>Select and enter localhost and port 8118 for both Web Proxy (HTTP)
and your Secure Web Proxy (HTTPS)</p>

<p>Using privoxy is <strong>necessary</strong> because <a
href="http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/CLIENTS">browsers leak your
DNS requests when they use a SOCKS proxy directly</a>, which is bad for
your anonymity. Privoxy also removes certain dangerous headers from your
web requests, and blocks obnoxious ad sites like Doubleclick.</p>

<p>To test if it's working, you need to know your normal IP address 
so you can verify that the address really changes when running Tor.
Your local IP address is shown by the <tt>ifconfig</tt> command.  
If you are behind a NAT/Firewall you can use one of the sites listed 
below to check which IP you are using.
When that is done, start Tor and Privoxy and visit any of the sites again.
If everything works, your IP address should have changed.
</p>

<p>
<!--<a href="http://peertech.org/privacy-knoppix/">peertech</a>, -->
<a href="http://www.showmyip.com/">showmyip.com</a> and
<a href="http://ipid.shat.net">ipid.shat.net</a>
are sites that show your current IP so you can see
what address and country you're coming from.
</p>

<p>
If you have a personal firewall that limits your computer's ability
to connect to itself, be sure to allow connections from your local
applications to
local port 8118 and port 9050. If your firewall blocks outgoing connections,
punch a hole so it can connect to at least TCP ports 80, 443, and 9001-9033.

</p>

<p>To Torify another application that supports HTTP, just point
it at Privoxy (that is, localhost port 8118). To use SOCKS
directly (for example, for instant messaging, Jabber, IRC, etc),
point your application directly at Tor (localhost port 9050). For
applications that support neither SOCKS nor HTTP, take a look at <a
href="http://www.taiyo.co.jp/~gotoh/ssh/connect.html">connect</a> or
<a href="http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/">socat</a>.
