=== AUTONAMING FOR TOR ===

Tor directory authorities may maintain a binding of server identities
(their long term identity key) and nicknames.  In their status documents
they may for each router they know tell if this is indeed the owner of
that nickname or not.

This toolset allows automatic maintaining of a binding list of nicknames
to identity keys, implementing Tor proposal 123[1].

The rules are simple:
 - A router claiming to be Bob is named (i.e. added to the binding list)
   if there currently does not exist a different binding for that
   nickname, the router has been around for a bit (2 weeks), no other
   router has used that nickname in a while (1 month).
 - A binding is removed if the server that owns it has not been seen
   in a long time (6 months).


=== REQUIREMENTS ===

 * ruby, and its postgres DBI interface (Debian packages: ruby, ruby1.8, libdbi-ruby1.8, libdbd-pg-ruby1.8)
 * postgres (tested with >= 8.1)
 * cron

=== SETUP ===

 * copy this tree some place, like into a 'auto-naming' directory in your Tor's
   data directory
 * create a database and a user, modifying db-config.rb accordingly
 * initialize the database by executing the sql statements in create-db.sql
 * setup a cronjob that feeds the current consensus to the process-consensus
   script regularly.
 * once the database is sufficiently populated, maybe a month or so after the
   previous step, setup a cronjob to regularly build the binding list using
   the build-approved-routers script.  You probably want to append a manually
   manged list of rejections to that file and give it to tor as its
   "approved-routers" file.
   The Sample-Makefile and Sample-crontab demonstrate the method used at tor26.
