This is basically a question of using your proxy or not. You can 
control the behaviour of your browser in great detail writing a 
proxy.pac program in Javascript and setting that program as the 
proxy autoconfiguration URL in your browser.

An example:

kris@jordan01:~> cat /srv/www/htdocs/proxy.pac

function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{
        var proxy_yes = "PROXY jordan01.int.cinetic.de:3128";
        var proxy_no  = "DIRECT";

        // Redirect all accesses to mlan hosts to the mlan proxy
        if (dnsDomainIs(host, ".mlan.cinetic.de")) {
                return proxy_yes;
        }

        // Everything else is direct
        return proxy_no;
}

So here the program checks if the destination is a mlan-Host, and 
if so, uses the appropriate proxy on jordan for the access, 
while all other accesses are direct.

You could do a similar thing with .onion accesses with a trivial 
modification.
