These are hacks to get polipo to work with Tor.  Someday, they will be
commited upstream to the real polipo codebase.  They need some work:
  - Merge the three makefiles into one with specific builds such as "make
    dist-osx" or "make dist-win32"
  - Configure the options for tor in polipo config, just leave them
    commented out for easy activation.
  - Work out better polipo config options for Tor.  

Instructions for building polipo under mingw32 for Windows:
1) Copy Makefile.mingw over Makefile.
2) Run 'make'. 

You should have a polipo.exe in the current directory.

If you want to build an installer using the Nullsoft Installer, install
the NSI Compiler.  In Windows Explorer, navigate to the directory in
which you placed polipo-mingw.nsi.  Right click on polipo-mingw.nsi and
choose Compile NSIS Script.  You'll then create a polipo installer.

Instructions for building a polipo universal binary package under OSX Tiger:
1) Copy Makefile.osx over Makefile.
2) Run 'make'.
3) Copy the contents of this directory into a directory named "contrib".
4) Run './contrib/package.sh'
5) You should have a Polipo-version.dmg ready for installation.
