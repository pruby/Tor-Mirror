torify \- wrapper for tsocks and tor

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtorify\fP\ \fIapplication\fP\ [\fIapplication's\ arguments\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtorify\fR is a simple wrapper that calls tsocks with a tor specific
configuration file.

tsocks itself is a wrapper between the tsocks library and the application
that you would like to run socksified.

Please note that since tsocks uses LD_PRELOAD, torify cannot be applied
to suid binaries.

You should also be aware that the way tsocks currently works only TCP
connections are socksified.  Be aware that this will in most circumstances
not include hostname lookups which would still be routed through your
normal system resolver to your usual resolving nameservers.  The Tor
FAQ at https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ might
have further information on this subject.
