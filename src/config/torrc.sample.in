# Logs go to stdout unless redirected by something else, like one of

### Send all messages of level 'warn' or higher to @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/warnings
#Log warn file @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/warnings
### Send all debug and info messages to @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug
#Log debug-info file @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug
### Send all debug messages ONLY to @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug
#Log debug-debug file @LOCALSTATEDIR@/log/tor/debug
### To use the system log instead of Tor's logfiles, uncomment these lines:
#Log notice syslog
### To send all messages to stderr:
#Log debug-err stderr

# Uncomment this to start the process in the background... or use
# --runasdaemon 1 on the command line.

# Tor only trusts directories signed with one of these keys, and
# uses the given addresses to connect to the trusted directory
# servers. If no DirServer lines are specified, Tor uses the built-in
# defaults (moria1, moria2, tor26), so you can leave this alone unless
# you need to change it.

## A comma-separated list of exit policies. They're considered first
## to last, and the first match wins. If you want to *replace*
## the default exit policy, end this with either a reject *:* or an
## accept *:*. Otherwise, you're *augmenting* (prepending to) the
## default exit policy. Leave commented to just use the default.
#ExitPolicy accept *:6660-6667
#ExitPolicy reject 192.168.0.1:*
