> ./autogen.sh 

runs auto* and then ./configure

It should be all you need to do to get working Makefiles on your
platform, whatever your platform is. :)

Then just do 

> make

Roger:

The summary is that I'm requiring all developers to have auto*
(aclocal, autoconf, automake) installed on their machine.

Since different versions of auto* generate vastly different output,
I'm going to leave its output out of the repository. This means that
whenever you check out a repository, you need to run auto* to generate
a configure file, then run ./configure to get a Makefile, then build.
