'tor' is an implementation of The Onion Routing system, as
described in a bit more detail at http://www.onion-router.net/. You
can read list archives, and subscribe to the mailing list, at

Is your question in the FAQ? Should it be?

See the INSTALL file for a quickstart. That is all you will probably need.

You only need to look beyond this point if the quickstart in the INSTALL
doesn't work for you.

Do you want to run a tor server?

  First, edit the bottom part of your torrc. Create the DataDirectory,
  and make sure it's owned by whoever will be running tor. Fix your system
  clock so it's not too far off. Make sure name resolution works. Make
  sure other people can reliably resolve the Address you chose.

  Then run tor to generate keys. One of the files generated
  in your DataDirectory is your 'fingerprint' file. Mail it to
  arma@mit.edu.

  NOTE: You won't be able to use tor as a client or server
  in this configuration until you've been added to the directory
  and can authenticate to the other nodes.

Configuring tsocks:

  If you want to use Tor for protocols that can't use Privoxy, or
  with applications that are not socksified, then download tsocks
  (tsocks.sourceforge.net) and configure it to talk to localhost:9050
  as a socks4 server. My /etc/tsocks.conf simply has:
    server_port = 9050
    server = 127.0.0.1
  (I had to "cd /usr/lib; ln -s /lib/libtsocks.so" to get the tsocks
   library working after install, since my libpath didn't include /lib.)
  Then you can do "tsocks ssh arma@moria.mit.edu". But note that if
  ssh is suid root, you either need to do this as root, or cp a local
  version of ssh that isn't suid.
