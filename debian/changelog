tor (0.0.1+0.0.2pre20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add torify script, documentation, and config file.  Means we also
    depend on tsocks now rather than just recommending it.  Right now
    we install it in debian/rules, but upcoming versions might install
    it in upstream's make install target.
  * There's an upstream ChangeLog file now.  Enjoy!
  * Add a README.privoxy file that explains how to setup privoxy to
    go over tor.
