    tiny.

tor (0.2.0.28-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Remove debian/patches/11_tor_as_root_more_helpful.dpatch as
    it is no longer needed:  We now setuid() to the Tor user
    when run as root and it all just works.
  * Add comments to the dpatch headers so lintian shuts up.
  * Add patches/14_fix_geoip_warning: Change geoipdb open failed message.
  * Require unit tests to pass again.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jun 2008 10:28:36 +0200

tor (0.2.0.27-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Add tor-geoipdb arch: all package for the geoip database.
  * Update debian/rules so that there now is a binary-common target
    and the binary-indep and binary-arch targets call make with
    proper DH_OPTIONS options.  This is taken from the template
    that dh_make nowadays uses for multi-binary packages.
  * Unit tests are broken, yay.
  * Use ${binary:Version} to depend on the right tor binary package from
    the tor-dbg package instead of ${Source-Version}.  Some guy on the
    internet said the latter was deprecated.
  * Add Homepage: https://www.torproject.org/ field to control file.
  * And mention www.tp.o instead of the old tor.eff.org in the long
    description.
  * No longer ignore failure of make clean in the clean target.
  * Support passing of parallel=<n> in build options.
  * Change declared Standards-Version to 3.8.0.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Fri, 06 Jun 2008 01:11:33 +0200

tor (0.2.0.26-rc-1) experimental; urgency=critical

  * New upstream version.
  * Conflict with old libssls.
  * On upgrading from versions prior to, including, 0.1.2.19-2, or
    from versions later than 0.2.0 and prior to 0.2.0.26-rc do the
    following, and if we are a server (we have a /var/lib/tor/keys
    directory)
    - move /var/lib/tor/keys/secret_onion_key out of the way.
    - move /var/lib/tor/keys/secret_onion_key.old out of the way.
    - move /var/lib/tor/keys/secret_id_key out of the way if it was
      created on or after 2006-09-17, which is the day the bad
      libssl was uploaded to Debian unstable.
  * Add a NEWS file explaining this change.

tor (0.2.0.23-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Mention OpenBSD_malloc_Linux.c in debian/copyright.
  * Add a recommends on logrotate.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Mar 2008 09:34:37 +0100

tor (0.2.0.22-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Work around fig2dev failing to build the images on all archs
    (re #457568).
  * Build with --enable-openbsd-malloc, unless no-enable-openbsd-malloc is
    found in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.  Hopefully this deals with some of the
    horrible memory fragmentation that glibc's malloc causes.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Mar 2008 08:03:47 +0100

tor (0.2.0.21-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Run --verify-config before start/reload/restart as root.  No longer
    su - to debian-tor tor run it.  Given that we now even start Tor as
    root (it setuids later on) this should be fine (closes: #468566).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Mar 2008 13:36:59 +0100

tor (0.2.0.20-rc-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Change the default for MAX_FILEDESCRIPTORS in our init script to depend
    on the number of system-wide available file descriptors:
    /proc/sys/fs/file-max is bigger than 80k, set ulimit -n to 32k, if it's
    greater than 40k set the limit to 16k, and when greater than 10k our limit
    shall be 8k descriptors.  If there are less than 20k FDs in the entire
    system default to a limit of only 1024.

    Big servers at the moment regularly use more than 10k FDs, so our old
    default of 8k no longer is sufficient.  On the other hand we don't want
    lower end systems to run out of FDs on Tor's account.
  * If we run as root also apply debian defaults.
  * Add User=debian-tor and Group=debian-tor to debian defaults.  That allows
    us to start Tor as root and have it setuid/setgid to the target user.
  * Change the init script to start Tor as root.  Now we should be able to
    bind to low port.

tor (0.2.0.19-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * It's 2008.  Now is the time to add copyright statements for 2007.
  * Forward port 03_tor_manpage_in_section_8.dpatch.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Feb 2008 01:12:04 +0100

tor (0.2.0.18-alpha-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Work around fig2dev failing to build the images on mipsel like we do on
    sparc and s390 (re #457568)
  * Fix postinst find command that chowns stuff to the right user.  Find
    does weird things in the presence of !.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Feb 2008 18:17:16 +0100

tor (0.2.0.18-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * postinst: Remove the check that requires the debian-tor user
    to have a uid between 100 and 999.  There is no good reason
    to require this.  If the local admin moves the system users/uid-space
    to some other range then they probably have a good reason for that.
  * postinst: change wording if debian-tor's homedir is wrong, do not
    print anything if it is ok.
  * postinst: We were only fixing the permissions of /var/{lib,run,log}/tor
    when we were not upgrading.  Unfortunately the check doesn't work all
    that well usually in cases where the package was removed (not purged)
    and then later re-installed again.  Now we ensure proper ownership
    and modes for all the directories and files below /var/{lib,run,log}/tor
    (the dirs themselves included) every time we run postinst.
  * postinst: if we reboot between unpacking and configuring on some smart
    systems this will mean that we just lost /var/run/tor - creating it
    in the maintainer script if it doesn't exist.
  * Create logfiles in logrotate so that they come into the world with the
    correct mode (o-r).

  * Previously our defaults for DataDirectory, PidFile, RunAsDaemon, and
    Log differed from upstreams.  Now Tor behaves just like before (with
    our own DataDirectory and all) only when run as the debian-tor user.
    If invoked as any other user, Tor will behave just like the pristine
    upstream version.
  * Tell users about the init script when they try to run Tor as root.
    Should we also do this when they try to run their Tor as any other
    (non root, non debian-tor) user? - add 11_tor_as_root_more_helpful
  * Use tor --verify-config before start and reload.  Abort init script
    with exit 1 if config does not verify.

tor (0.1.1.7-alpha-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * More merging from 0.1.0.14+XXXX:
    - The tor-dbg package does not really need its own copy of copyright
      and changelog in usr/share/doc/tor-dbg.
  * Forward port 03_tor_manpage_in_section_8.dpatch

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Sep 2005 15:15:34 +0200

tor (0.1.0.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Ship debugging information in a separate package now, instead
    of simply not stripping tor.  This is still useful while tor is
    young.  Ideally it would go away some time.
  * Add LSB comments to init script as suggested by Petter Reinholdtsen
    on the debian-devel list:
    - http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01172.html
    - http://wiki.debian.net/?LSBInitScripts
  * Work around broken chroots that do not resolve localhost or resolve
    it to the wrong IP.  We now catch such cases in debian/rules, shout
    at the buildd maintainer, and ignore the result of our test suite.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Sep 2005 10:23:25 +0200

tor (0.1.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version - changes, among others:
    - Fixes the other half of the bug with crypto handshakes (CVE-2005-2643).
  * Since gs-gpl on s390 is broken (#321435) and unable to
    build PDFs of our images for the design paper this version
    ships them in the source and uses them on s390, should building
    them from source really fail.
  * Increase standards-version from 3.6.1 to 3.6.2.  No changes
    necessary.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon,  8 Aug 2005 23:55:05 +0200

tor (0.1.0.13-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version:
    - Explicitly set no-unaligned-access for sparc in configure.in.
      it turns out the new gcc's let you compile broken code, but
      that doesn't make it not-broken (closes: #320140).
    - Fix a critical bug in the security of our crypto handshakes.
      (Therefore set urgency to high).
    and more (see upstream changelog).
  * Slightly improve init script to give you proper error messages when
    you do not run it as root.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Aug 2005 01:27:49 +0200

tor (0.1.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version:
    - New IP for tor26 directory server,
    - fix a possible double-free in tor_gzip_uncompress,
    - and more (see upstream changelog).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Jul 2005 17:36:24 +0200

tor (0.1.0.11-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream version (closes: #316753):
    - Fixes a serious bug: servers now honor their exit policies -
      In 0.1.0.x only clients enforced them so far.  0.0.9.x is
      not affected.
  * Build depend on libevent-dev >= 1.1.
  * Urgency high because 0.0.9.10-1 did not make it into testing after
    like 3 weeks because of an impending ftp-master move.  So I might
    just as well upload this one.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon,  4 Jul 2005 17:53:48 +0200

tor (0.1.0.10-0.pre.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Forward port 03_tor_manpage_in_section_8.
  * Forward port 06_add_compile_time_defaults.
  * Add libevent-dev to build-depends.
  * Update URL to tor in debian/control and debian/copyright.
  * Add a snippet to disable epoll in etc/default/tor, commented out.
  * Add a snippet to set nice level in etc/default/tor.
  * Wait for 60 seconds in init stop.  35 is too little.
  * Don't depend on python anymore - tor-resolve is C now.
  * If "with-dmalloc" is in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS we build against libdmalloc4.
    Of course the -dev package needs to be installed.
  * Update README.Debian to say that upstream now does have a default
    for DataDirectory.
  * Don't fail in the init script when we cannot raise the ulimit.
    Instead just warn a bit (closes: #312882).

tor (0.0.9.10-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * While we're waiting for a newer libevent to enter sid, make another
    upload of the 0.0.9.x tree:
    - Refuse relay cells that claim to have a length larger than the
      maximum allowed. This prevents a potential attack that could read
      arbitrary memory (e.g. keys) from an exit server's process
      (CVE-2005-2050).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jun 2005 22:56:11 +0200

tor (0.0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Upstream used newer auto* tools, so hopefully the new config.sub
    and config.guess files (2003-08-18) are good enough to build
    tor on ppc64 (closes: #300376: FTBFS on ppc64).

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Fri, 25 Mar 2005 01:34:28 +0100

tor (0.0.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Set ulimit for file descriptors to 4096 in our init
    script.
  * Use SIGINT to shutdown tor.  That way - if you are a server -
    tor will stop accepting new connections immediately, and
    give existing connections a grace period of 30 seconds in
    which they might complete their task.  If you just run a
    client it should make no difference.

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9rc7-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    For real this time.  Looks like our rc6 orig.tar.gz
    was in fact the rc5 one.
  * forward port patches/07_log_to_file_by_default

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9rc6-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (candidate).
    - cleans up more integer underflows that don't look exploitable.
      But one never knows (-> medium).
  * Remove those 'date' calls in debian/rules again that were
    added in rc5-1.

 -- Peter Palfrader <weasel@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Dec 2004 11:11:23 +0100

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9rc5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (candidate).
    - medium because it fixes an integer overflow that might
      be exploitable, but doesn't seem to be currently.
  * Add a few 'date' calls in debian/rules, so I can see how long
    building the docs take on autobuilders.

tor (0.0.8+0.0.9pre5-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Symlink tor(8) manpage to torrc(5).
  * Make logs readable by the system administrators (group adm).
  * Point to /var/log/tor (the directory) instead of a single
    file (/var/log/tor/log) in the debian patch of the manpage.
  * Do not patch the default torrc to include settings we really want.
    Instead modify the compiled in default options.  Those settings are

    - RunAsDaemon is enabled by default.
    - PidFile is set to /var/run/tor/tor.pid.  No default upstream.
    - default logging goes to /var/log/tor/log instead of stdout.
    - DataDirectory is set to /var/lib/tor by default.  No default upstream.

    This is also documented in the new debian/README.Debian.
  * Remove /usr/bin/tor-control.py from the binary package, it is
    not really useful yet, and wasn't meant to be installed by
    default.
  * Change init startup script to properly deal with tor
    printing stuff on startup.

  * Make sure all patches apply cleanly.
  * No longer use --pidfile, --logfile, and --runasdaemon
    command line options.  Set them in the configfile instead.
  * Change the description slightly, to say "don't rely on the current Tor
    network if you really need strong anonymity", instead of "Tor will not
    provide anonymity currently".

  * Build tor-design.{pdf,ps}, wich adds new build-dependencies:
    tetex-{bin,extra}, transfig, and gs.
  * Support DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS option 'nodoc' to skip building tor-design.
    With nodoc the build will not need tetex-{bin,extra}, transfig, and gs.

    it in upstream's make install target.
  * There's an upstream ChangeLog file now.  Enjoy!
  * Add a README.privoxy file that explains how to setup privoxy to
    go over tor.
  * As is the case too often, the INSTALL file not only covers
    installation, but also basic usage and configuration.  Therefore
    include it in the docs dir.
  * Add a lintian override for the INSTALL file.
