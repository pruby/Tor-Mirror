tor (0.0.1+0.0.2pre22-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Upstream has moved tor back to usr/bin, but we will keep it in
    usr/sbin.  That's the right place and it doesn't break my tab
    completion there.

tor (0.0.1+0.0.2pre21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * 0.0.2pre20-2 removed the Recommends: on privoxy rather
    than tsocks (which is now required) by mistake.  Fix that.
  * package description: Mention that the package starts the OP by default and
    that OR can be enabled in the config.
  * tor moved to sbin, updating init script.

tor (0.0.1+0.0.2pre20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add torify script, documentation, and config file.  Means we also
    depend on tsocks now rather than just recommending it.  Right now
    we install it in debian/rules, but upcoming versions might install
    it in upstream's make install target.
  * There's an upstream ChangeLog file now.  Enjoy!
  * Add a README.privoxy file that explains how to setup privoxy to
    go over tor.
  * As is the case too often, the INSTALL file not only covers
    installation, but also basic usage and configuration.  Therefore
    include it in the docs dir.
  * Add a lintian override for the INSTALL file.
