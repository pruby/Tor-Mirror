# If tor is seriously hogging your CPU, taking away too much cycles from
# other system resources, then you can renice tor.  See nice(1) for a
# bit more information.  Another way to limit the CPU usage of an Onion
# Router is to set a lower BandwidthRate, as CPU usage is mostly a function
# of the amount of traffic flowing through your node.  Consult the torrc(5)
# manual page for more information on setting BandwidthRate.
