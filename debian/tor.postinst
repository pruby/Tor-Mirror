It has been discovered that the random number generator in Debian's
openssl package is predictable.  This is caused by an incorrect
Debian-specific change to the openssl package (CVE-2008-0166).  As a
result, cryptographic key material may be guessable.

See Debian Security Advisory number 1571 (DSA-1571) for more information:
http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2008/msg00152.html

The Debian package for Tor has moved away the onion keys upon package
upgrade, and it will have moved away your identity key if it was created
in the affected timeframe.  There is no sure way to automatically tell
if your key was created with an affected openssl library, so this move
is done unconditionally.

If you have restarted Tor since this change (and the package probably
did that for you already unless you configured your system differently)
then the Tor daemon already created new keys for itself and in all
likelyhood is already working just fine with new keys.

If you are absolutely certain that your identity key was created with
a non-affected version of openssl and for some reason you have to retain
the old identity, then you can move back the copy of secret_id_key to
/var/lib/tor/keys.  Do not move back the onion keys, they were created
only recently since they are temporary keys with a lifetime of only a few
days anyway.

Sincerely,
Peter Palfrader, Tue, 13 May 2008 13:32:23 +0200
