This is the Debian package for Tor, The Onion Router.

The following changes have been made to the Tor source to integrate it better
into Debian:

- RunAsDaemon is enabled by default.
- PidFile is set to /var/run/tor/tor.pid.  No default upstream.
- default logging goes to /var/log/tor/log instead of stdout.
- DataDirectory is set to /var/lib/tor by default.  Uses $HOME/.tor upstream.
