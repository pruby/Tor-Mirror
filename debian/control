Description: anonymizing overlay network for TCP
 Tor is a connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system which
 addresses many flaws in the original onion routing design.
 .
 In brief, Onion Routing is a connection-oriented anonymizing communication
 service. Users choose a source-routed path through a set of nodes, and
 negotiate a "virtual circuit" through the network, in which each node
 knows its predecessor and successor, but no others. Traffic flowing down
 the circuit is unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node, which reveals
 the downstream node.
 .
 Basically Tor provides a distributed network of servers ("onion
 routers"). Users bounce their tcp streams (web traffic, ftp, ssh, etc)
 around the routers, and recipients, observers, and even the routers
 themselves have difficulty tracking the source of the stream.
 .
 Note that Tor does no protocol cleaning.  That means there is a danger that
 application protocols and associated programs can be induced to reveal
 information about the initiator.  Tor depends on Privoxy and similar protocol
 cleaners to solve this problem.
 .
 Client applications can use the Tor network by connecting to the local
 onion proxy.  If the application itself does not come with socks support
 you can use a socks client such as tsocks.  Some web browsers like mozilla
 and web proxies like privoxy come with socks support, so you don't need an
 extra socks client if you want to use Tor with them.
 .
 This package enables only the onion proxy by default, but it can be configured
 as a relay (server) node.
 .
 Remember that this is development code -- don't rely on the current Tor
 network if you really need strong anonymity.

Package: tor-dbg
Architecture: any
Depends: tor (= ${Source-Version})
Suggests: gdb
Priority: extra
Description: debugging symbols for Tor
 This package provides the debugging symbols for Tor, The Onion Router.
 Those symbols allow your debugger to assign names to your backtraces, which
 makes it somewhat easier to interpret core dumps.

Package: tor-geoipdb
Architecture: all
Priority: extra
Depends: tor (>= ${source:Version})
Description: geoIP database for Tor
 This package provides a geoIP database for Tor, i.e. it maps IPv4 addresses
 to countries.
 .
 Bridges (special Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor directory) use
 this information to report which countries they get access from.  This allows
 the Tor network operators to learn if certain countries started blocking
 access to bridges.
