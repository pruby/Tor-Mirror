Changes in version 0.1.1.2-alpha - 2005-07-14
  o New directory servers:
    - tor26 has changed IP address.

  o Bugfixes on 0.1.0.x, crashes/leaks:
    - Port the servers-not-obeying-their-exit-policies fix from 0.1.0.11.
    - Fix an fd leak in start_daemon().
    - On Windows, you can't always reopen a port right after you've
      closed it. So change retry_listeners() to only close and re-open
      ports that have changed.
    - Fix a possible double-free in tor_gzip_uncompress().

  o Bugfixes on 0.1.0.x, usability:
    - When tor_socketpair() fails in Windows, give a reasonable
      Windows-style errno back.
    - Let people type "tor --install" as well as "tor -install" when they
      want to make it an NT service.
    - NT service patch from Matt Edman to improve error messages.
    - When the controller asks for a config option with an abbreviated
      name, give the full name in our response.
    - Correct the man page entry on TrackHostExitsExpire.
    - Looks like we were never delivering deflated (i.e. compressed)
      running-routers lists, even when asked. Oops.
    - When --disable-threads is set, do not search for or link against
      pthreads libraries.

  o Bugfixes on 0.1.1.x:
    - Fix a seg fault with autodetecting which controller version is
      being used.

  o Features:
    - New hidden service descriptor format: put a version in it, and
      let people specify introduction/rendezvous points that aren't
      in "the directory" (which is subjective anyway).
    - Allow the DEBUG controller event to work again. Mark certain log
      entries as "don't tell this to controllers", so we avoid cycles.


Changes in version 0.1.1.1-alpha - 2005-06-29
  o Bugfixes:
    - Make OS X init script check for missing argument, so we don't
      confuse users who invoke it incorrectly.
    - Fix a seg fault in "tor --hash-password foo".
    - Fix a possible way to DoS dirservers.
    - When we complain that your exit policy implicitly allows local or
      private address spaces, name them explicitly so operators can
      fix it.
    - Make the log message less scary when all the dirservers are
      temporarily unreachable.
    - We were printing the number of idle dns workers incorrectly when
      culling them.

  o Features:
    - Revised controller protocol (version 1) that uses ascii rather
      than binary. Add supporting libraries in python and java so you
      can use the controller from your applications without caring how
      our protocol works.
    - Spiffy new support for crypto hardware accelerators. Can somebody
      test this?


Changes in version 0.1.0.11 - 2005-06-30
  o Bugfixes on 0.1.0.x:
    - Fix major security bug: servers were disregarding their
      exit policies if clients behaved unexpectedly.
    - Make OS X init script check for missing argument, so we don't
      confuse users who invoke it incorrectly.
    - Fix a seg fault in "tor --hash-password foo".
    - The MAPADDRESS control command was broken.


Changes in version 0.1.0.10 - 2005-06-14
  o Fixes on Win32:
    - Make NT services work and start on startup on Win32 (based on
      patch by Matt Edman). See the FAQ entry for details.
    - Make 'platform' string in descriptor more accurate for Win32
      servers, so it's not just "unknown platform".
    - REUSEADDR on normal platforms means you can rebind to the port
      right after somebody else has let it go. But REUSEADDR on Win32
      means you can bind to the port _even when somebody else already
      has it bound_! So, don't do that on Win32.
    - Clean up the log messages when starting on Win32 with no config
      file.
    - Allow seeding the RNG on Win32 even when you're not running as
      Administrator. If seeding the RNG on Win32 fails, quit.

  o Assert / crash bugs:
    - Refuse relay cells that claim to have a length larger than the
      maximum allowed. This prevents a potential attack that could read
      arbitrary memory (e.g. keys) from an exit server's process.
    - If unofficial Tor clients connect and send weird TLS certs, our
      Tor server triggers an assert. Stop asserting, and start handling
      TLS errors better in other situations too.
    - Fix a race condition that can trigger an assert when we have a
      pending create cell and an OR connection attempt fails.

  o Resource leaks:
    - Use pthreads for worker processes rather than forking. This was
      forced because when we forked, we ended up wasting a lot of
      duplicate ram over time.
      - Also switch to foo_r versions of some library calls to allow
        reentry and threadsafeness.
      - Implement --disable-threads configure option. Disable threads on
        netbsd and openbsd by default, because they have no reentrant
        resolver functions (!), and on solaris since it has other
        threading issues.
    - Fix possible bug on threading platforms (e.g. win32) which was
      leaking a file descriptor whenever a cpuworker or dnsworker died.
    - Fix a minor memory leak when somebody establishes an introduction
      point at your Tor server.
    - Fix possible memory leak in tor_lookup_hostname(). (Thanks to
      Adam Langley.)
    - Add ./configure --with-dmalloc option, to track memory leaks.
    - And try to free all memory on closing, so we can detect what
      we're leaking.

  o Protocol correctness:
    - When we've connected to an OR and handshaked but didn't like
      the result, we were closing the conn without sending destroy
      cells back for pending circuits. Now send those destroys.
    - Start sending 'truncated' cells back rather than destroy cells
      if the circuit closes in front of you. This means we won't have
      to abandon partially built circuits.
    - Handle changed router status correctly when dirserver reloads
      fingerprint file. We used to be dropping all unverified descriptors
      right then. The bug was hidden because we would immediately
      fetch a directory from another dirserver, which would include the
      descriptors we just dropped.
    - Revise tor-spec to add more/better stream end reasons.
    - Revise all calls to connection_edge_end to avoid sending 'misc',
      and to take errno into account where possible.
    - Client now retries when streams end early for 'hibernating' or
      'resource limit' reasons, rather than failing them.
    - Try to be more zealous about calling connection_edge_end when
      things go bad with edge conns in connection.c.

  o Robustness improvements:
    - Better handling for heterogeneous / unreliable nodes:
      - Annotate circuits with whether they aim to contain high uptime
        nodes and/or high capacity nodes. When building circuits, choose
        appropriate nodes.
      - This means that every single node in an intro rend circuit,
        not just the last one, will have a minimum uptime.
      - New config option LongLivedPorts to indicate application streams
        that will want high uptime circuits.
      - Servers reset uptime when a dir fetch entirely fails. This
        hopefully reflects stability of the server's network connectivity.
      - If somebody starts his tor server in Jan 2004 and then fixes his
        clock, don't make his published uptime be a year.
      - Reset published uptime when we wake up from hibernation.
    - Introduce a notion of 'internal' circs, which are chosen without
      regard to the exit policy of the last hop. Intro and rendezvous
      circs must be internal circs, to avoid leaking information. Resolve
      and connect streams can use internal circs if they want.
    - New circuit pooling algorithm: keep track of what destination ports
      we've used recently (start out assuming we'll want to use 80), and
      make sure to have enough circs around to satisfy these ports. Also
      make sure to have 2 internal circs around if we've required internal
      circs lately (and with high uptime if we've seen that lately too).
    - Turn addr_policy_compare from a tristate to a quadstate; this should
      help address our "Ah, you allow 1.2.3.4:80. You are a good choice
      for google.com" problem.
    - When a client asks us for a dir mirror and we don't have one,
      launch an attempt to get a fresh one.
    - First cut at support for "create-fast" cells. Clients can use
      these when extending to their first hop, since the TLS already
      provides forward secrecy and authentication. Not enabled on
      clients yet.

  o Reachability testing.
    - Your Tor server will automatically try to see if its ORPort and
      DirPort are reachable from the outside, and it won't upload its
      descriptor until it decides at least ORPort is reachable (when
      DirPort is not yet found reachable, publish it as zero).
    - When building testing circs for ORPort testing, use only
      high-bandwidth nodes, so fewer circuits fail.
    - Notice when our IP changes, and reset stats/uptime/reachability.
    - Authdirservers don't do ORPort reachability detection, since
      they're in clique mode, so it will be rare to find a server not
      already connected to them.
    - Authdirservers now automatically approve nodes running 0.1.0.2-rc
      or later.

  o Dirserver fixes:
    - Now we allow two unverified servers with the same nickname
      but different keys. But if a nickname is verified, only that
      nickname+key are allowed.
    - If you're an authdirserver connecting to an address:port,
      and it's not the OR you were expecting, forget about that
      descriptor. If he *was* the one you were expecting, then forget
      about all other descriptors for that address:port.
    - Allow servers to publish descriptors from 12 hours in the future.
      Corollary: only whine about clock skew from the dirserver if
      he's a trusted dirserver (since now even verified servers could
      have quite wrong clocks).
    - Require servers that use the default dirservers to have public IP
      addresses. We have too many servers that are configured with private
      IPs and their admins never notice the log entries complaining that
      their descriptors are being rejected.

  o Efficiency improvements:
    - Use libevent. Now we can use faster async cores (like epoll, kpoll,
      and /dev/poll), and hopefully work better on Windows too.
      - Apple's OS X 10.4.0 ships with a broken kqueue API, and using
        kqueue on 10.3.9 causes kernel panics. Don't use kqueue on OS X.
      - Find libevent even if it's hiding in /usr/local/ and your
        CFLAGS and LDFLAGS don't tell you to look there.
      - Be able to link with libevent as a shared library (the default
        after 1.0d), even if it's hiding in /usr/local/lib and even
        if you haven't added /usr/local/lib to your /etc/ld.so.conf,
        assuming you're running gcc. Otherwise fail and give a useful
        error message.
    - Switch to a new buffer management algorithm, which tries to avoid
      reallocing and copying quite as much. In first tests it looks like
      it uses *more* memory on average, but less cpu.
    - Switch our internal buffers implementation to use a ring buffer,
      to hopefully improve performance for fast servers a lot.
    - Reenable the part of the code that tries to flush as soon as an
      OR outbuf has a full TLS record available. Perhaps this will make
      OR outbufs not grow as huge except in rare cases, thus saving lots
      of CPU time plus memory.
    - Improve performance for dirservers: stop re-parsing the whole
      directory every time you regenerate it.
    - Keep a big splay tree of (circid,orconn)->circuit mappings to make
      it much faster to look up a circuit for each relay cell.
    - Remove most calls to assert_all_pending_dns_resolves_ok(),
      since they're eating our cpu on exit nodes.
    - Stop wasting time doing a case insensitive comparison for every
      dns name every time we do any lookup. Canonicalize the names to
      lowercase when you first see them.

  o Hidden services:
    - Handle unavailable hidden services better. Handle slow or busy
      hidden services better.
    - Cannibalize GENERAL circs to be C_REND, C_INTRO, S_INTRO, and S_REND
      circ as necessary, if there are any completed ones lying around
      when we try to launch one.
    - Make hidden services try to establish a rendezvous for 30 seconds
      after fetching the descriptor, rather than for n (where n=3)
      attempts to build a circuit.
    - Adjust maximum skew and age for rendezvous descriptors: let skew
      be 48 hours rather than 90 minutes.
    - Reject malformed .onion addresses rather then passing them on as
      normal web requests.

  o Controller:
    - More Tor controller support. See
      http://tor.eff.org/doc/control-spec.txt for all the new features,
      including signals to emulate unix signals from any platform;
      redirectstream; extendcircuit; mapaddress; getinfo; postdescriptor;
      closestream; closecircuit; etc.
    - Encode hashed controller passwords in hex instead of base64,
      to make it easier to write controllers.
    - Revise control spec and implementation to allow all log messages to
      be sent to controller with their severities intact (suggested by
      Matt Edman). Disable debug-level logs while delivering a debug-level
      log to the controller, to prevent loop. Update TorControl to handle
      new log event types.

  o New config options/defaults:
    - Begin scrubbing sensitive strings from logs by default. Turn off
      the config option SafeLogging if you need to do debugging.
    - New exit policy: accept most low-numbered ports, rather than
      rejecting most low-numbered ports.
    - Put a note in the torrc about abuse potential with the default
      exit policy.
    - Add support for CONNECTing through https proxies, with "HttpsProxy"
      config option.
    - Add HttpProxyAuthenticator and HttpsProxyAuthenticator support
      based on patch from Adam Langley (basic auth only).
    - Bump the default BandwidthRate from 1 MB to 2 MB, to accommodate
      the fast servers that have been joining lately. (Clients are now
      willing to load balance over up to 2 MB of advertised bandwidth
      capacity too.)
    - New config option MaxAdvertisedBandwidth which lets you advertise
      a low bandwidthrate (to not attract as many circuits) while still
      allowing a higher bandwidthrate in reality.
    - Require BandwidthRate to be at least 20kB/s for servers.
    - Add a NoPublish config option, so you can be a server (e.g. for
      testing running Tor servers in other Tor networks) without
      publishing your descriptor to the primary dirservers.
    - Add a new AddressMap config directive to rewrite incoming socks
      addresses. This lets you, for example, declare an implicit
      required exit node for certain sites.
    - Add a new TrackHostExits config directive to trigger addressmaps
      for certain incoming socks addresses -- for sites that break when
      your exit keeps changing (based on patch from Mike Perry).
    - Split NewCircuitPeriod option into NewCircuitPeriod (30 secs),
      which describes how often we retry making new circuits if current
      ones are dirty, and MaxCircuitDirtiness (10 mins), which describes
      how long we're willing to make use of an already-dirty circuit.
    - Change compiled-in SHUTDOWN_WAIT_LENGTH from a fixed 30 secs to
      a config option "ShutdownWaitLength" (when using kill -INT on
      servers).
    - Fix an edge case in parsing config options: if they say "--"
      on the commandline, it's not a config option (thanks weasel).
    - New config option DirAllowPrivateAddresses for authdirservers.
      Now by default they refuse router descriptors that have non-IP or
      private-IP addresses.
    - Change DirFetchPeriod/StatusFetchPeriod to have a special "Be
      smart" default value: low for servers and high for clients.
    - Some people were putting "Address  " in their torrc, and they had
      a buggy resolver that resolved " " to 0.0.0.0. Oops.
    - If DataDir is ~/.tor, and that expands to /.tor, then default to
      LOCALSTATEDIR/tor instead.
    - Implement --verify-config command-line option to check if your torrc
      is valid without actually launching Tor.

  o Logging improvements:
    - When dirservers refuse a server descriptor, we now log its
      contactinfo, platform, and the poster's IP address.
    - Only warn once per nickname from add_nickname_list_to_smartlist()
      per failure, so an entrynode or exitnode choice that's down won't
      yell so much.
    - When we're connecting to an OR and he's got a different nickname/key
      than we were expecting, only complain loudly if we're an OP or a
      dirserver. Complaining loudly to the OR admins just confuses them.
    - Whine at you if you're a server and you don't set your contactinfo.
    - Warn when exit policy implicitly allows local addresses.
    - Give a better warning when some other server advertises an
      ORPort that is actually an apache running ssl.
    - If we get an incredibly skewed timestamp from a dirserver mirror
      that isn't a verified OR, don't warn -- it's probably him that's
      wrong.
    - When a dirserver causes you to give a warn, mention which dirserver
      it was.
    - Initialize libevent later in the startup process, so the logs are
      already established by the time we start logging libevent warns.
    - Use correct errno on win32 if libevent fails.
    - Check and warn about known-bad/slow libevent versions.
    - Stop warning about sigpipes in the logs. We're going to
      pretend that getting these occassionally is normal and fine.

  o New contrib scripts:
    - New experimental script tor/contrib/exitlist: a simple python
      script to parse directories and find Tor nodes that exit to listed
      addresses/ports.
    - New experimental script tor/contrib/ExerciseServer.py (needs more
      work) that uses the controller interface to build circuits and
      fetch pages over them. This will help us bootstrap servers that
      have lots of capacity but haven't noticed it yet.
    - New experimental script tor/contrib/PathDemo.py (needs more work)
      that uses the controller interface to let you choose whole paths
      via addresses like
      "<hostname>.<path,separated by dots>.<length of path>.path"
    - New contributed script "privoxy-tor-toggle" to toggle whether
      Privoxy uses Tor. Seems to be configured for Debian by default.
    - Have torctl.in/tor.sh.in check for location of su binary (needed
      on FreeBSD)

  o Misc bugfixes:
    - chdir() to your datadirectory at the *end* of the daemonize process,
      not the beginning. This was a problem because the first time you
      run tor, if your datadir isn't there, and you have runasdaemon set
      to 1, it will try to chdir to it before it tries to create it. Oops.
    - Fix several double-mark-for-close bugs, e.g. where we were finding
      a conn for a cell even if that conn is already marked for close.
    - Stop most cases of hanging up on a socks connection without sending
      the socks reject.
    - Fix a bug in the RPM package: set home directory for _tor to
      something more reasonable when first installing.
    - Stop putting nodename in the Platform string in server descriptors.
      It doesn't actually help, and it is confusing/upsetting some people.
    - When using preferred entry or exit nodes, ignore whether the
      circuit wants uptime or capacity. They asked for the nodes, they
      get the nodes.
    - Tie MAX_DIR_SIZE to MAX_BUF_SIZE, so now directory sizes won't get
      artificially capped at 500kB.
    - Cache local dns resolves correctly even when they're .exit
      addresses.
    - If we're hibernating and we get a SIGINT, exit immediately.
    - tor-resolve requests were ignoring .exit if there was a working circuit
      they could use instead.
    - Pay more attention to the ClientOnly config option.
    - Resolve OS X installer bugs: stop claiming to be 0.0.9.2 in certain
      installer screens; and don't put stuff into StartupItems unless
      the user asks you to.

  o Misc features:
    - Rewrite address "serifos.exit" to "externalIP.serifos.exit"
      rather than just rejecting it.
    - If our clock jumps forward by 100 seconds or more, assume something
      has gone wrong with our network and abandon all not-yet-used circs.
    - When an application is using socks5, give him the whole variety of
      potential socks5 responses (connect refused, host unreachable, etc),
      rather than just "success" or "failure".
    - A more sane version numbering system. See
      http://tor.eff.org/cvs/tor/doc/version-spec.txt for details.
    - Change version parsing logic: a version is "obsolete" if it is not
      recommended and (1) there is a newer recommended version in the
      same series, or (2) there are no recommended versions in the same
      series, but there are some recommended versions in a newer series.
      A version is "new" if it is newer than any recommended version in
      the same series.
    - Report HTTP reasons to client when getting a response from directory
      servers -- so you can actually know what went wrong.
    - Reject odd-looking addresses at the client (e.g. addresses that
      contain a colon), rather than having the server drop them because
      they're malformed.
    - Stop publishing socksport in the directory, since it's not
      actually meant to be public. For compatibility, publish a 0 there
      for now.
    - Since we ship our own Privoxy on OS X, tweak it so it doesn't write
      cookies to disk and doesn't log each web request to disk. (Thanks
      to Brett Carrington for pointing this out.)
    - Add OSX uninstall instructions. An actual uninstall script will
      come later.
    - Add "opt hibernating 1" to server descriptor to make it clearer
      whether the server is hibernating.


Changes in version 0.0.9.10 - 2005-06-16
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9.x (backported from 0.1.0.10):
    - Refuse relay cells that claim to have a length larger than the
      maximum allowed. This prevents a potential attack that could read
      arbitrary memory (e.g. keys) from an exit server's process.


Changes in version 0.0.9.9 - 2005-04-23
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9.x:
    - If unofficial Tor clients connect and send weird TLS certs, our
      Tor server triggers an assert. This release contains a minimal
      backport from the broader fix that we put into 0.1.0.4-rc.


Changes in version 0.0.9.8 - 2005-04-07
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9.x:
    - We have a bug that I haven't found yet. Sometimes, very rarely,
      cpuworkers get stuck in the 'busy' state, even though the cpuworker
      thinks of itself as idle. This meant that no new circuits ever got
      established. Here's a workaround to kill any cpuworker that's been
      busy for more than 100 seconds.


Changes in version 0.0.9.7 - 2005-04-01
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9.x:
    - Fix another race crash bug (thanks to Glenn Fink for reporting).
    - Compare identity to identity, not to nickname, when extending to
      a router not already in the directory. This was preventing us from
      extending to unknown routers. Oops.
    - Make sure to create OS X Tor user in <500 range, so we aren't
      creating actual system users.
    - Note where connection-that-hasn't-sent-end was marked, and fix
      a few really loud instances of this harmless bug (it's fixed more
      in 0.1.0.x).


Changes in version 0.0.9.6 - 2005-03-24
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9.x (crashes and asserts):
    - Add new end stream reasons to maintainance branch. Fix bug where
      reason (8) could trigger an assert.  Prevent bug from recurring.
    - Apparently win32 stat wants paths to not end with a slash.
    - Fix assert triggers in assert_cpath_layer_ok(), where we were
      blowing away the circuit that conn->cpath_layer points to, then
      checking to see if the circ is well-formed. Backport check to make
      sure we dont use the cpath on a closed connection.
    - Prevent circuit_resume_edge_reading_helper() from trying to package
      inbufs for marked-for-close streams.
    - Don't crash on hup if your options->address has become unresolvable.
    - Some systems (like OS X) sometimes accept() a connection and tell
      you the remote host is 0.0.0.0:0. If this happens, due to some
      other mis-features, we get confused; so refuse the conn for now.

  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9.x (other):
    - Fix harmless but scary "Unrecognized content encoding" warn message.
    - Add new stream error reason: TORPROTOCOL reason means "you are not
      speaking a version of Tor I understand; say bye-bye to your stream."
    - Be willing to cache directories from up to ROUTER_MAX_AGE seconds
      into the future, now that we are more tolerant of skew. This
      resolves a bug where a Tor server would refuse to cache a directory
      because all the directories it gets are too far in the future;
      yet the Tor server never logs any complaints about clock skew.
    - Mac packaging magic: make man pages useable, and do not overwrite
      existing torrc files.
    - Make OS X log happily to /var/log/tor/tor.log


Changes in version 0.0.9.5 - 2005-02-22
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9.x:
    - Fix an assert race at exit nodes when resolve requests fail.
    - Stop picking unverified dir mirrors--it only leads to misery.
    - Patch from Matt Edman to make NT services work better. Service
      support is still not compiled into the executable by default.
    - Patch from Dmitri Bely so the Tor service runs better under
      the win32 SYSTEM account.
    - Make tor-resolve actually work (?) on Win32.
    - Fix a sign bug when getrlimit claims to have 4+ billion
      file descriptors available.
    - Stop refusing to start when bandwidthburst == bandwidthrate.
    - When create cells have been on the onion queue more than five
      seconds, just send back a destroy and take them off the list.


Changes in version 0.0.9.4 - 2005-02-03
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9:
    - Fix an assert bug that took down most of our servers: when
      a server claims to have 1 GB of bandwidthburst, don't
      freak out.
    - Don't crash as badly if we have spawned the max allowed number
      of dnsworkers, or we're out of file descriptors.
    - Block more file-sharing ports in the default exit policy.
    - MaxConn is now automatically set to the hard limit of max
      file descriptors we're allowed (ulimit -n), minus a few for
      logs, etc.
    - Give a clearer message when servers need to raise their
      ulimit -n when they start running out of file descriptors.
    - SGI Compatibility patches from Jan Schaumann.
    - Tolerate a corrupt cached directory better.
    - When a dirserver hasn't approved your server, list which one.
    - Go into soft hibernation after 95% of the bandwidth is used,
      not 99%. This is especially important for daily hibernators who
      have a small accounting max. Hopefully it will result in fewer
      cut connections when the hard hibernation starts.
    - Load-balance better when using servers that claim more than
      800kB/s of capacity.
    - Make NT services work (experimental, only used if compiled in).


Changes in version 0.0.9.3 - 2005-01-21
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9:
    - Backport the cpu use fixes from main branch, so busy servers won't
      need as much processor time.
    - Work better when we go offline and then come back, or when we
      run Tor at boot before the network is up. We do this by
      optimistically trying to fetch a new directory whenever an
      application request comes in and we think we're offline -- the
      human is hopefully a good measure of when the network is back.
    - Backport some minimal hidserv bugfixes: keep rend circuits open as
      long as you keep using them; actually publish hidserv descriptors
      shortly after they change, rather than waiting 20-40 minutes.
    - Enable Mac startup script by default.
    - Fix duplicate dns_cancel_pending_resolve reported by Giorgos Pallas.
    - When you update AllowUnverifiedNodes or FirewallPorts via the
      controller's setconf feature, we were always appending, never
      resetting.
    - When you update HiddenServiceDir via setconf, it was screwing up
      the order of reading the lines, making it fail.
    - Do not rewrite a cached directory back to the cache; otherwise we
      will think it is recent and not fetch a newer one on startup.
    - Workaround for webservers that lie about Content-Encoding: Tor
      now tries to autodetect compressed directories and compression
      itself. This lets us Proxypass dir fetches through apache.


Changes in version 0.0.9.2 - 2005-01-04
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9 (crashes and asserts):
    - Fix an assert on startup when the disk is full and you're logging
      to a file.
    - If you do socks4 with an IP of 0.0.0.x but *don't* provide a socks4a
      style address, then we'd crash.
    - Fix an assert trigger when the running-routers string we get from
      a dirserver is broken.
    - Make worker threads start and run on win32. Now win32 servers
      may work better.
    - Bandaid (not actually fix, but now it doesn't crash) an assert
      where the dns worker dies mysteriously and the main Tor process
      doesn't remember anything about the address it was resolving.

  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9 (Win32):
    - Workaround for brain-damaged __FILE__ handling on MSVC: keep Nick's
      name out of the warning/assert messages.
    - Fix a superficial "unhandled error on read" bug on win32.
    - The win32 installer no longer requires a click-through for our
      license, since our Free Software license grants rights but does not
      take any away.
    - Win32: When connecting to a dirserver fails, try another one
      immediately. (This was already working for non-win32 Tors.)
    - Stop trying to parse $HOME on win32 when hunting for default
      DataDirectory.
    - Make tor-resolve.c work on win32 by calling network_init().

  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9 (other):
    - Make 0.0.9.x build on Solaris again.
    - Due to a fencepost error, we were blowing away the \n when reporting
      confvalue items in the controller. So asking for multiple config
      values at once couldn't work.
    - When listing circuits that are pending on an opening OR connection,
      if we're an OR we were listing circuits that *end* at us as
      being pending on every listener, dns/cpu worker, etc. Stop that.
    - Dirservers were failing to create 'running-routers' or 'directory'
      strings if we had more than some threshold of routers. Fix them so
      they can handle any number of routers.
    - Fix a superficial "Duplicate mark for close" bug.
    - Stop checking for clock skew for OR connections, even for servers.
    - Fix a fencepost error that was chopping off the last letter of any
      nickname that is the maximum allowed nickname length.
    - Update URLs in log messages so they point to the new website.
    - Fix a potential problem in mangling server private keys while
      writing to disk (not triggered yet, as far as we know).
    - Include the licenses for other free software we include in Tor,
      now that we're shipping binary distributions more regularly.


Changes in version 0.0.9.1 - 2004-12-15
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.9:
    - Make hibernation actually work.
    - Make HashedControlPassword config option work.
    - When we're reporting event circuit status to a controller,
      don't use the stream status code.


Changes in version 0.0.9 - 2004-12-12
  o Bugfixes on 0.0.8.1 (Crashes and asserts):
    - Catch and ignore SIGXFSZ signals when log files exceed 2GB; our
      write() call will fail and we handle it there.
    - When we run out of disk space, or other log writing error, don't
      crash. Just stop logging to that log and continue.
    - Fix isspace() and friends so they still make Solaris happy
      but also so they don't trigger asserts on win32.
    - Fix assert failure on malformed socks4a requests.
    - Fix an assert bug where a hidden service provider would fail if
      the first hop of his rendezvous circuit was down.
    - Better handling of size_t vs int, so we're more robust on 64
      bit platforms.

  o Bugfixes on 0.0.8.1 (Win32):
    - Make windows sockets actually non-blocking (oops), and handle
      win32 socket errors better.
    - Fix parse_iso_time on platforms without strptime (eg win32).
    - win32: when being multithreaded, leave parent fdarray open.
    - Better handling of winsock includes on non-MSV win32 compilers.
    - Change our file IO stuff (especially wrt OpenSSL) so win32 is
      happier.
    - Make unit tests work on win32.

  o Bugfixes on 0.0.8.1 (Path selection and streams):
    - Calculate timeout for waiting for a connected cell from the time
      we sent the begin cell, not from the time the stream started. If
      it took a long time to establish the circuit, we would time out
      right after sending the begin cell.
    - Fix router_compare_addr_to_addr_policy: it was not treating a port
      of * as always matching, so we were picking reject *:* nodes as
      exit nodes too. Oops.
    - When read() failed on a stream, we would close it without sending
      back an end. So 'connection refused' would simply be ignored and
      the user would get no response.
    - Stop a sigpipe: when an 'end' cell races with eof from the app,
      we shouldn't hold-open-until-flush if the eof arrived first.
    - Let resolve conns retry/expire also, rather than sticking around
      forever.
    - Fix more dns related bugs: send back resolve_failed and end cells
      more reliably when the resolve fails, rather than closing the
      circuit and then trying to send the cell. Also attach dummy resolve
      connections to a circuit *before* calling dns_resolve(), to fix
      a bug where cached answers would never be sent in RESOLVED cells.

  o Bugfixes on 0.0.8.1 (Circuits):
    - Finally fix a bug that's been plaguing us for a year:
      With high load, circuit package window was reaching 0. Whenever
      we got a circuit-level sendme, we were reading a lot on each
      socket, but only writing out a bit. So we would eventually reach
      eof. This would be noticed and acted on even when there were still
      bytes sitting in the inbuf.
    - Use identity comparison, not nickname comparison, to choose which
      half of circuit-ID-space each side gets to use. This is needed
      because sometimes we think of a router as a nickname, and sometimes
      as a hex ID, and we can't predict what the other side will do.

  o Bugfixes on 0.0.8.1 (Other):
    - Fix a whole slew of memory leaks.
    - Disallow NDEBUG. We don't ever want anybody to turn off debug.
    - If we are using select, make sure we stay within FD_SETSIZE.
    - When poll() is interrupted, we shouldn't believe the revents values.
    - Add a FAST_SMARTLIST define to optionally inline smartlist_get
      and smartlist_len, which are two major profiling offenders.
    - If do_hup fails, actually notice.
    - Flush the log file descriptor after we print "Tor opening log file",
      so we don't see those messages days later.
    - Hidden service operators now correctly handle version 1 style
      INTRODUCE1 cells (nobody generates them still, so not a critical
      bug).
    - Handle more errnos from accept() without closing the listener.
      Some OpenBSD machines were closing their listeners because
      they ran out of file descriptors.
    - Some people had wrapped their tor client/server in a script
      that would restart it whenever it died. This did not play well
      with our "shut down if your version is obsolete" code. Now people
      don't fetch a new directory if their local cached version is
      recent enough.
    - Make our autogen.sh work on ksh as well as bash.
    - Better torrc example lines for dirbindaddress and orbindaddress.
    - Improved bounds checking on parsed ints (e.g. config options and
      the ones we find in directories.)
    - Stop using separate defaults for no-config-file and
      empty-config-file. Now you have to explicitly turn off SocksPort,
      if you don't want it open.
    - We were starting to daemonize before we opened our logs, so if
      there were any problems opening logs, we would complain to stderr,
      which wouldn't work, and then mysteriously exit.
    - If a verified OR connects to us before he's uploaded his descriptor,
      or we verify him and hup but he still has the original TLS
      connection, then conn->nickname is still set like he's unverified.

  o Code security improvements, inspired by Ilja:
    - tor_snprintf wrapper over snprintf with consistent (though not C99)
      overflow behavior.
    - Replace sprintf with tor_snprintf. (I think they were all safe, but
      hey.)
    - Replace strcpy/strncpy with strlcpy in more places.
    - Avoid strcat; use tor_snprintf or strlcat instead.

  o Features (circuits and streams):
    - New circuit building strategy: keep a list of ports that we've
      used in the past 6 hours, and always try to have 2 circuits open
      or on the way that will handle each such port. Seed us with port
      80 so web users won't complain that Tor is "slow to start up".
    - Make kill -USR1 dump more useful stats about circuits.
    - When warning about retrying or giving up, print the address, so
      the user knows which one it's talking about.
    - If you haven't used a clean circuit in an hour, throw it away,
      just to be on the safe side. (This means after 6 hours a totally
      unused Tor client will have no circuits open.)
    - Support "foo.nickname.exit" addresses, to let Alice request the
      address "foo" as viewed by exit node "nickname". Based on a patch
      from Geoff Goodell.
    - If your requested entry or exit node has advertised bandwidth 0,
      pick it anyway.
    - Be more greedy about filling up relay cells -- we try reading again
      once we've processed the stuff we read, in case enough has arrived
      to fill the last cell completely.
    - Refuse application socks connections to port 0.
    - Use only 0.0.9pre1 and later servers for resolve cells.

  o Features (bandwidth):
    - Hibernation: New config option "AccountingMax" lets you
      set how many bytes per month (in each direction) you want to
      allow your server to consume. Rather than spreading those
      bytes out evenly over the month, we instead hibernate for some
      of the month and pop up at a deterministic time, work until
      the bytes are consumed, then hibernate again. Config option
      "MonthlyAccountingStart" lets you specify which day of the month
      your billing cycle starts on.
    - Implement weekly/monthly/daily accounting: now you specify your
      hibernation properties by
      AccountingMax N bytes|KB|MB|GB|TB
      AccountingStart day|week|month [day] HH:MM
        Defaults to "month 1 0:00".
    - Let bandwidth and interval config options be specified as 5 bytes,
      kb, kilobytes, etc; and as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks.

  o Features (directories):
    - New "router-status" line in directory, to better bind each verified
      nickname to its identity key.
    - Clients can ask dirservers for /dir.z to get a compressed version
      of the directory. Only works for servers running 0.0.9, of course.
    - Make clients cache directories and use them to seed their router
      lists at startup. This means clients have a datadir again.
    - Respond to content-encoding headers by trying to uncompress as
      appropriate.
    - Clients and servers now fetch running-routers; cache
      running-routers; compress running-routers; serve compressed
      running-routers.z
    - Make moria2 advertise a dirport of 80, so people behind firewalls
      will be able to get a directory.
    - Http proxy support
      - Dirservers translate requests for http://%s:%d/x to /x
      - You can specify "HttpProxy %s[:%d]" and all dir fetches will
        be routed through this host.
      - Clients ask for /tor/x rather than /x for new enough dirservers.
        This way we can one day coexist peacefully with apache.
      - Clients specify a "Host: %s%d" http header, to be compatible
        with more proxies, and so running squid on an exit node can work.
    - Protect dirservers from overzealous descriptor uploading -- wait
      10 seconds after directory gets dirty, before regenerating.

  o Features (packages and install):
    - Add NSI installer contributed by J Doe.
    - Apply NT service patch from Osamu Fujino. Still needs more work.
    - Commit VC6 and VC7 workspace/project files.
    - Commit a tor.spec for making RPM files, with help from jbash.
    - Add contrib/torctl.in contributed by Glenn Fink.
    - Make expand_filename handle ~ and ~username.
    - Use autoconf to enable largefile support where necessary. Use
      ftello where available, since ftell can fail at 2GB.
    - Ship src/win32/ in the tarball, so people can use it to build.
    - Make old win32 fall back to CWD if SHGetSpecialFolderLocation
      is broken.

  o Features (ui controller):
    - Control interface: a separate program can now talk to your
      client/server over a socket, and get/set config options, receive
      notifications of circuits and streams starting/finishing/dying,
      bandwidth used, etc. The next step is to get some GUIs working.
      Let us know if you want to help out. See doc/control-spec.txt .
    - Ship a contrib/tor-control.py as an example script to interact
      with the control port.
    - "tor --hash-password zzyxz" will output a salted password for
      use in authenticating to the control interface.
    - Implement the control-spec's SAVECONF command, to write your
      configuration to torrc.
    - Get cookie authentication for the controller closer to working.
    - When set_conf changes our server descriptor, upload a new copy.
      But don't upload it too often if there are frequent changes.

  o Features (config and command-line):
    - Deprecate unofficial config option abbreviations, and abbreviations
      not on the command line.
    - Configuration infrastructure support for warning on obsolete
      options.
    - Give a slightly more useful output for "tor -h".
    - Break DirFetchPostPeriod into:
      - DirFetchPeriod for fetching full directory,
      - StatusFetchPeriod for fetching running-routers,
      - DirPostPeriod for posting server descriptor,
      - RendPostPeriod for posting hidden service descriptors.
    - New log format in config:
      "Log minsev[-maxsev] stdout|stderr|syslog" or
      "Log minsev[-maxsev] file /var/foo"
    - DirPolicy config option, to let people reject incoming addresses
      from their dirserver.
    - "tor --list-fingerprint" will list your identity key fingerprint
      and then exit.
    - Make tor --version --version dump the cvs Id of every file.
    - New 'MyFamily nick1,...' config option for a server to
      specify other servers that shouldn't be used in the same circuit
      with it. Only believed if nick1 also specifies us.
    - New 'NodeFamily nick1,nick2,...' config option for a client to
      specify nodes that it doesn't want to use in the same circuit.
    - New 'Redirectexit pattern address:port' config option for a
      server to redirect exit connections, e.g. to a local squid.
    - Add "pass" target for RedirectExit, to make it easier to break
      out of a sequence of RedirectExit rules.
    - Make the dirservers file obsolete.
      - Include a dir-signing-key token in directories to tell the
        parsing entity which key is being used to sign.
      - Remove the built-in bulky default dirservers string.
      - New config option "Dirserver %s:%d [fingerprint]", which can be
        repeated as many times as needed. If no dirservers specified,
        default to moria1,moria2,tor26.
      - Make 'Routerfile' config option obsolete.
    - Discourage people from setting their dirfetchpostperiod more often
      than once per minute.

  o Features (other):
    - kill -USR2 now moves all logs to loglevel debug (kill -HUP to
      get back to normal.)
    - Accept *:706 (silc) in default exit policy.
    - Implement new versioning format for post 0.1.
    - Distinguish between TOR_TLS_CLOSE and TOR_TLS_ERROR, so we can
      log more informatively.
    - Check clock skew for verified servers, but allow unverified
      servers and clients to have any clock skew.
    - Make sure the hidden service descriptors are at a random offset
      from each other, to hinder linkability.
    - Clients now generate a TLS cert too, in preparation for having
      them act more like real nodes.
    - Add a pure-C tor-resolve implementation.
    - Use getrlimit and friends to ensure we can reach MaxConn (currently
      1024) file descriptors.
    - Raise the max dns workers from 50 to 100.


Changes in version 0.0.8.1 - 2004-10-13
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix a seg fault that can be triggered remotely for Tor
      clients/servers with an open dirport.
    - Fix a rare assert trigger, where routerinfos for entries in
      our cpath would expire while we're building the path.
    - Fix a bug in OutboundBindAddress so it (hopefully) works.
    - Fix a rare seg fault for people running hidden services on
      intermittent connections.
    - Fix a bug in parsing opt keywords with objects.
    - Fix a stale pointer assert bug when a stream detaches and
      reattaches.
    - Fix a string format vulnerability (probably not exploitable)
      in reporting stats locally.
    - Fix an assert trigger: sometimes launching circuits can fail
      immediately, e.g. because too many circuits have failed recently.
    - Fix a compile warning on 64 bit platforms.


Changes in version 0.0.8 - 2004-08-25
  o Bugfixes:
    - Made our unit tests compile again on OpenBSD 3.5, and tor
      itself compile again on OpenBSD on a sparc64.
    - We were neglecting milliseconds when logging on win32, so
      everything appeared to happen at the beginning of each second.
    - Check directory signature _before_ you decide whether you're
      you're running an obsolete version and should exit.
    - Check directory signature _before_ you parse the running-routers
      list to decide who's running.
    - Check return value of fclose while writing to disk, so we don't
      end up with broken files when servers run out of disk space.
    - Port it to SunOS 5.9 / Athena
    - Fix two bugs in saving onion keys to disk when rotating, so
      hopefully we'll get fewer people using old onion keys.
    - Remove our mostly unused -- and broken -- hex_encode()
      function. Use base16_encode() instead. (Thanks to Timo Lindfors
      for pointing out this bug.)
    - Only pick and establish intro points after we've gotten a
      directory.
    - Fix assert triggers: if the other side returns an address 0.0.0.0,
      don't put it into the client dns cache.
    - If a begin failed due to exit policy, but we believe the IP
      address should have been allowed, switch that router to exitpolicy
      reject *:* until we get our next directory.

  o Protocol changes:
    - 'Extend' relay cell payloads now include the digest of the
      intended next hop's identity key. Now we can verify that we're
      extending to the right router, and also extend to routers we
      hadn't heard of before.

  o Features:
    - Tor nodes can now act as relays (with an advertised ORPort)
      without being manually verified by the dirserver operators.
      - Uploaded descriptors of unverified routers are now accepted
        by the dirservers, and included in the directory.
      - Verified routers are listed by nickname in the running-routers
        list; unverified routers are listed as "$<fingerprint>".
      - We now use hash-of-identity-key in most places rather than
        nickname or addr:port, for improved security/flexibility.
      - AllowUnverifiedNodes config option to let circuits choose no-name
        routers in entry,middle,exit,introduction,rendezvous positions.
        Allow middle and rendezvous positions by default.
      - When picking unverified routers, skip those with low uptime and/or
        low bandwidth, depending on what properties you care about.
      - ClientOnly option for nodes that never want to become servers.
    - Directory caching.
      - "AuthoritativeDir 1" option for the official dirservers.
      - Now other nodes (clients and servers) will cache the latest
        directory they've pulled down.
      - They can enable their DirPort to serve it to others.
      - Clients will pull down a directory from any node with an open
        DirPort, and check the signature/timestamp correctly.
      - Authoritative dirservers now fetch directories from other
        authdirservers, to stay better synced.
      - Running-routers list tells who's down also, along with noting
        if they're verified (listed by nickname) or unverified (listed
        by hash-of-key).
      - Allow dirservers to serve running-router list separately.
        This isn't used yet.
      - You can now fetch $DIRURL/running-routers to get just the
        running-routers line, not the whole descriptor list. (But
        clients don't use this yet.)
    - Clients choose nodes proportional to advertised bandwidth.
    - Clients avoid using nodes with low uptime as introduction points.
    - Handle servers with dynamic IP addresses: don't just replace
      options->Address with the resolved one at startup, and
      detect our address right before we make a routerinfo each time.
    - 'FascistFirewall' option to pick dirservers and ORs on specific
      ports; plus 'FirewallPorts' config option to tell FascistFirewall
      which ports are open. (Defaults to 80,443)
    - Try other dirservers immediately if the one you try is down. This
      should tolerate down dirservers better now.
    - ORs connect-on-demand to other ORs
      - If you get an extend cell to an OR you're not connected to,
        connect, handshake, and forward the create cell.
      - The authoritative dirservers stay connected to everybody,
        and everybody stays connected to 0.0.7 servers, but otherwise
        clients/servers expire unused connections after 5 minutes.
    - When servers get a sigint, they delay 30 seconds (refusing new
      connections) then exit. A second sigint causes immediate exit.
    - File and name management:
      - Look for .torrc if no CONFDIR "torrc" is found.
      - If no datadir is defined, then choose, make, and secure ~/.tor
        as datadir.
      - If torrc not found, exitpolicy reject *:*.
      - Expands ~/ in filenames to $HOME/ (but doesn't yet expand ~arma).
      - If no nickname is defined, derive default from hostname.
      - Rename secret key files, e.g. identity.key -> secret_id_key,
        to discourage people from mailing their identity key to tor-ops.
    - Refuse to build a circuit before the directory has arrived --
      it won't work anyway, since you won't know the right onion keys
      to use.
    - Parse tor version numbers so we can do an is-newer-than check
      rather than an is-in-the-list check.
    - New socks command 'resolve', to let us shim gethostbyname()
      locally.
      - A 'tor_resolve' script to access the socks resolve functionality.
      - A new socks-extensions.txt doc file to describe our
        interpretation and extensions to the socks protocols.
    - Add a ContactInfo option, which gets published in descriptor.
    - Write tor version at the top of each log file
    - New docs in the tarball:
      - tor-doc.html.
      - Document that you should proxy your SSL traffic too.
    - Log a warning if the user uses an unsafe socks variant, so people
      are more likely to learn about privoxy or socat.
    - Log a warning if you're running an unverified server, to let you
      know you might want to get it verified.
    - Change the default exit policy to reject the default edonkey,
      kazaa, gnutella ports.
    - Add replace_file() to util.[ch] to handle win32's rename().
    - Publish OR uptime in descriptor (and thus in directory) too.
    - Remember used bandwidth (both in and out), and publish 15-minute
      snapshots for the past day into our descriptor.
    - Be more aggressive about trying to make circuits when the network
      has changed (e.g. when you unsuspend your laptop).
    - Check for time skew on http headers; report date in response to
      "GET /".
    - If the entrynode config line has only one node, don't pick it as
      an exitnode.
    - Add strict{entry|exit}nodes config options. If set to 1, then
      we refuse to build circuits that don't include the specified entry
      or exit nodes.
    - OutboundBindAddress config option, to bind to a specific
      IP address for outgoing connect()s.
    - End truncated log entries (e.g. directories) with "[truncated]".


Changes in version 0.0.7.3 - 2004-08-12
  o Stop dnsworkers from triggering an assert failure when you
    ask them to resolve the host "".


Changes in version 0.0.7.2 - 2004-07-07
  o A better fix for the 0.0.0.0 problem, that will hopefully
    eliminate the remaining related assertion failures.


Changes in version 0.0.7.1 - 2004-07-04
  o When an address resolves to 0.0.0.0, treat it as a failed resolve,
    since internally we use 0.0.0.0 to signify "not yet resolved".


Changes in version 0.0.7 - 2004-06-07
  o Fixes for crashes and other obnoxious bugs:
    - Fix an epipe bug: sometimes when directory connections failed
      to connect, we would give them a chance to flush before closing
      them.
    - When we detached from a circuit because of resolvefailed, we
      would immediately try the same circuit twice more, and then
      give up on the resolve thinking we'd tried three different
      exit nodes.
    - Limit the number of intro circuits we'll attempt to build for a
      hidden service per 15-minute period.
    - Check recommended-software string *early*, before actually parsing
      the directory. Thus we can detect an obsolete version and exit,
      even if the new directory format doesn't parse.
  o Fixes for security bugs:
    - Remember which nodes are dirservers when you startup, and if a
      random OR enables his dirport, don't automatically assume he's
      a trusted dirserver.
  o Other bugfixes:
    - Directory connections were asking the wrong poll socket to
      start writing, and not asking themselves to start writing.
    - When we detached from a circuit because we sent a begin but
      didn't get a connected, we would use it again the first time;
      but after that we would correctly switch to a different one.
    - Stop warning when the first onion decrypt attempt fails; they
      will sometimes legitimately fail now that we rotate keys.
    - Override unaligned-access-ok check when $host_cpu is ia64 or
      arm. Apparently they allow it but the kernel whines.
    - Dirservers try to reconnect periodically too, in case connections
      have failed.
    - Fix some memory leaks in directory servers.
    - Allow backslash in Win32 filenames.
    - Made Tor build complain-free on FreeBSD, hopefully without
      breaking other BSD builds. We'll see.
    - Check directory signatures based on name of signer, not on whom
      we got the directory from. This will let us cache directories more
      easily.
    - Rotate dnsworkers and cpuworkers on SIGHUP, so they get new config
      settings too.
  o Features:
    - Doxygen markup on all functions and global variables.
    - Make directory functions update routerlist, not replace it. So
      now directory disagreements are not so critical a problem.
    - Remove the upper limit on number of descriptors in a dirserver's
      directory (not that we were anywhere close).
    - Allow multiple logfiles at different severity ranges.
    - Allow *BindAddress to specify ":port" rather than setting *Port
      separately. Allow multiple instances of each BindAddress config
      option, so you can bind to multiple interfaces if you want.
    - Allow multiple exit policy lines, which are processed in order.
      Now we don't need that huge line with all the commas in it.
    - Enable accept/reject policies on SOCKS connections, so you can bind
      to 0.0.0.0 but still control who can use your OP.
    - Updated the man page to reflect these features.


Changes in version 0.0.6.2 - 2004-05-16
  o Our integrity-checking digest was checking only the most recent cell,
    not the previous cells like we'd thought.
    Thanks to Stefan Mark for finding the flaw!


Changes in version 0.0.6.1 - 2004-05-06
  o Fix two bugs in our AES counter-mode implementation (this affected
    onion-level stream encryption, but not TLS-level). It turns
    out we were doing something much more akin to a 16-character
    polyalphabetic cipher. Oops.
    Thanks to Stefan Mark for finding the flaw!
  o Retire moria3 as a directory server, and add tor26 as a directory
    server.


Changes in version 0.0.6 - 2004-05-02
  o Features:
    - Hidden services and rendezvous points are implemented. Go to
      http://6sxoyfb3h2nvok2d.onion/ for an index of currently available
      hidden services. (This only works via a socks4a proxy such as
      Privoxy, and currently it's quite slow.)
    - We now rotate link (tls context) keys and onion keys.
    - CREATE cells now include oaep padding, so you can tell
      if you decrypted them correctly.
    - Retry stream correctly when we fail to connect because of
      exit-policy-reject (should try another) or can't-resolve-address.
    - When we hup a dirserver and we've *removed* a server from the
      approved-routers list, now we remove that server from the
      in-memory directories too.
    - Add bandwidthburst to server descriptor.
    - Directories now say which dirserver signed them.
    - Use a tor_assert macro that logs failed assertions too.
    - Since we don't support truncateds much, don't bother sending them;
      just close the circ.
    - Fetch randomness from /dev/urandom better (not via fopen/fread)
    - Better debugging for tls errors
    - Set Content-Type on the directory and hidserv descriptor.
    - Remove IVs from cipher code, since AES-ctr has none.
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix an assert trigger for exit nodes that's been plaguing us since
      the days of 0.0.2prexx (thanks weasel!)
    - Fix a bug where we were closing tls connections intermittently.
      It turns out openssl keeps its errors around -- so if an error
      happens, and you don't ask about it, and then another openssl
      operation happens and succeeds, and you ask if there was an error,
      it tells you about the first error.
    - Fix a bug that's been lurking since 27 may 03 (!)
      When passing back a destroy cell, we would use the wrong circ id.
    - Don't crash if a conn that sent a begin has suddenly lost its circuit.
    - Some versions of openssl have an SSL_pending function that erroneously
      returns bytes when there is a non-application record pending.
    - Win32 fixes. Tor now compiles on win32 with no warnings/errors.
      o We were using an array of length zero in a few places.
      o Win32's gethostbyname can't resolve an IP to an IP.
      o Win32's close can't close a socket.
      o Handle windows socket errors correctly.
  o Portability:
    - check for <sys/limits.h> so we build on FreeBSD again, and
      <machine/limits.h> for NetBSD.


Changes in version 0.0.5 - 2004-03-30
  o Install torrc as torrc.sample -- we no longer clobber your
    torrc. (Woo!)
  o Fix mangled-state bug in directory fetching (was causing sigpipes).
  o Only build circuits after we've fetched the directory: clients were
    using only the directory servers before they'd fetched a directory.
    This also means longer startup time; so it goes.
  o Fix an assert trigger where an OP would fail to handshake, and we'd
    expect it to have a nickname.
  o Work around a tsocks bug: do a socks reject when AP connection dies
    early, else tsocks goes into an infinite loop.
  o Hold socks connection open until reply is flushed (if possible)
  o Make exit nodes resolve IPs to IPs immediately, rather than asking
    the dns farm to do it.
  o Fix c99 aliasing warnings in rephist.c
  o Don't include server descriptors that are older than 24 hours in the
    directory.
  o Give socks 'reject' replies their whole 15s to attempt to flush,
    rather than seeing the 60s timeout and assuming the flush had failed.
  o Clean automake droppings from the cvs repository
  o Add in a 'notice' log level for things the operator should hear
    but that aren't warnings


Changes in version 0.0.4 - 2004-03-26
  o When connecting to a dirserver or OR and the network is down,
    we would crash.


Changes in version 0.0.3 - 2004-03-26
  o Warn and fail if server chose a nickname with illegal characters
  o Port to Solaris and Sparc:
    - include missing header fcntl.h
    - have autoconf find -lsocket -lnsl automatically
    - deal with hardware word alignment
    - make uname() work (solaris has a different return convention)
    - switch from using signal() to sigaction()
  o Preliminary work on reputation system:
    - Keep statistics on success/fail of connect attempts; they're published
      by kill -USR1 currently.
    - Add a RunTesting option to try to learn link state by creating test
      circuits, even when SocksPort is off.
    - Remove unused open circuits when there are too many.


Changes in version 0.0.2 - 2004-03-19
    - Include strlcpy and strlcat for safer string ops
    - define INADDR_NONE so we compile (but still not run) on solaris


Changes in version 0.0.2pre27 - 2004-03-14
  o Bugfixes:
    - Allow internal tor networks (we were rejecting internal IPs,
      now we allow them if they're set explicitly).
    - And fix a few endian issues.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre26 - 2004-03-14
  o New features:
    - If a stream times out after 15s without a connected cell, don't
      try that circuit again: try a new one.
    - Retry streams at most 4 times. Then give up.
    - When a dirserver gets a descriptor from an unknown router, it
      logs its fingerprint (so the dirserver operator can choose to
      accept it even without mail from the server operator).
    - Inform unapproved servers when we reject their descriptors.
    - Make tor build on Windows again. It works as a client, who knows
      about as a server.
    - Clearer instructions in the torrc for how to set up a server.
    - Be more efficient about reading fd's when our global token bucket
      (used for rate limiting) becomes empty.
  o Bugfixes:
    - Stop asserting that computers always go forward in time. It's
      simply not true.
    - When we sent a cell (e.g. destroy) and then marked an OR connection
      expired, we might close it before finishing a flush if the other
      side isn't reading right then.
    - Don't allow dirservers to start if they haven't defined
      RecommendedVersions
    - We were caching transient dns failures. Oops.
    - Prevent servers from publishing an internal IP as their address.
    - Address a strcat vulnerability in circuit.c


Changes in version 0.0.2pre25 - 2004-03-04
  o New features:
    - Put the OR's IP in its router descriptor, not its fqdn. That way
      we'll stop being stalled by gethostbyname for nodes with flaky dns,
      e.g. poblano.
  o Bugfixes:
    - If the user typed in an address that didn't resolve, the server
      crashed.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre24 - 2004-03-03
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix an assertion failure in dns.c, where we were trying to dequeue
      a pending dns resolve even if it wasn't pending
    - Fix a spurious socks5 warning about still trying to write after the
      connection is finished.
    - Hold certain marked_for_close connections open until they're finished
      flushing, rather than losing bytes by closing them too early.
    - Correctly report the reason for ending a stream
    - Remove some duplicate calls to connection_mark_for_close
    - Put switch_id and start_daemon earlier in the boot sequence, so it
      will actually try to chdir() to options.DataDirectory
    - Make 'make test' exit(1) if a test fails; fix some unit tests
    - Make tor fail when you use a config option it doesn't know about,
      rather than warn and continue.
    - Make --version work
    - Bugfixes on the rpm spec file and tor.sh, so it's more up to date


Changes in version 0.0.2pre23 - 2004-02-29
  o New features:
    - Print a statement when the first circ is finished, so the user
      knows it's working.
    - If a relay cell is unrecognized at the end of the circuit,
      send back a destroy. (So attacks to mutate cells are more
      clearly thwarted.)
    - New config option 'excludenodes' to avoid certain nodes for circuits.
    - When it daemonizes, it chdir's to the DataDirectory rather than "/",
      so you can collect coredumps there.
 o Bugfixes:
    - Fix a bug in tls flushing where sometimes data got wedged and
      didn't flush until more data got sent. Hopefully this bug was
      a big factor in the random delays we were seeing.
    - Make 'connected' cells include the resolved IP, so the client
      dns cache actually gets populated.
    - Disallow changing from ORPort=0 to ORPort>0 on hup.
    - When we time-out on a stream and detach from the circuit, send an
      end cell down it first.
    - Only warn about an unknown router (in exitnodes, entrynodes,
      excludenodes) after we've fetched a directory.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre22 - 2004-02-26
  o New features:
    - Servers publish less revealing uname information in descriptors.
    - More memory tracking and assertions, to crash more usefully when
      errors happen.
    - If the default torrc isn't there, just use some default defaults.
      Plus provide an internal dirservers file if they don't have one.
    - When the user tries to use Tor as an http proxy, give them an http
      501 failure explaining that we're a socks proxy.
    - Dump a new router.desc on hup, to help confused people who change
      their exit policies and then wonder why router.desc doesn't reflect
      it.
    - Clean up the generic tor.sh init script that we ship with.
  o Bugfixes:
    - If the exit stream is pending on the resolve, and a destroy arrives,
      then the stream wasn't getting removed from the pending list. I
      think this was the one causing recent server crashes.
    - Use a more robust poll on OSX 10.3, since their poll is flaky.
    - When it couldn't resolve any dirservers, it was useless from then on.
      Now it reloads the RouterFile (or default dirservers) if it has no
      dirservers.
    - Move the 'tor' binary back to /usr/local/bin/ -- it turns out
      many users don't even *have* a /usr/local/sbin/.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre21 - 2004-02-18
  o New features:
    - There's a ChangeLog file that actually reflects the changelog.
    - There's a 'torify' wrapper script, with an accompanying
      tor-tsocks.conf, that simplifies the process of using tsocks for
      tor. It even has a man page.
    - The tor binary gets installed to sbin rather than bin now.
    - Retry streams where the connected cell hasn't arrived in 15 seconds
    - Clean up exit policy handling -- get the default out of the torrc,
      so we can update it without forcing each server operator to fix
      his/her torrc.
    - Allow imaps and pop3s in default exit policy
  o Bugfixes:
    - Prevent picking middleman nodes as the last node in the circuit


Changes in version 0.0.2pre20 - 2004-01-30
  o New features:
    - We now have a deb package, and it's in debian unstable. Go to
      it, apt-getters. :)
    - I've split the TotalBandwidth option into BandwidthRate (how many
      bytes per second you want to allow, long-term) and
      BandwidthBurst (how many bytes you will allow at once before the cap
      kicks in).  This better token bucket approach lets you, say, set
      BandwidthRate to 10KB/s and BandwidthBurst to 10MB, allowing good
      performance while not exceeding your monthly bandwidth quota.
    - Push out a tls record's worth of data once you've got it, rather
      than waiting until you've read everything waiting to be read. This
      may improve performance by pipelining better. We'll see.
    - Add an AP_CONN_STATE_CONNECTING state, to allow streams to detach
      from failed circuits (if they haven't been connected yet) and attach
      to new ones.
    - Expire old streams that haven't managed to connect. Some day we'll
      have them reattach to new circuits instead.

  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix several memory leaks that were causing servers to become bloated
      after a while.
    - Fix a few very rare assert triggers. A few more remain.
    - Setuid to User _before_ complaining about running as root.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre19 - 2004-01-07
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix deadlock condition in dns farm. We were telling a child to die by
      closing the parent's file descriptor to him. But newer children were
      inheriting the open file descriptor from the parent, and since they
      weren't closing it, the socket never closed, so the child never read
      eof, so he never knew to exit. Similarly, dns workers were holding
      open other sockets, leading to all sorts of chaos.
    - New cleaner daemon() code for forking and backgrounding.
    - If you log to a file, it now prints an entry at the top of the
      logfile so you know it's working.
    - The onionskin challenge length was 30 bytes longer than necessary.
    - Started to patch up the spec so it's not quite so out of date.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre18 - 2004-01-02
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix endian issues with the 'integrity' field in the relay header.
    - Fix a potential bug where connections in state
      AP_CONN_STATE_CIRCUIT_WAIT might unexpectedly ask to write.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre17 - 2003-12-30
  o Bugfixes:
    - Made --debuglogfile (or any second log file, actually) work.
    - Resolved an edge case in get_unique_circ_id_by_conn where a smart
      adversary could force us into an infinite loop.

  o Features:
    - Each onionskin handshake now includes a hash of the computed key,
      to prove the server's identity and help perfect forward secrecy.
    - Changed cell size from 256 to 512 bytes (working toward compatibility
      with MorphMix).
    - Changed cell length to 2 bytes, and moved it to the relay header.
    - Implemented end-to-end integrity checking for the payloads of
      relay cells.
    - Separated streamid from 'recognized' (otherwise circuits will get
      messed up when we try to have streams exit from the middle). We
      use the integrity-checking to confirm that a cell is addressed to
      this hop.
    - Randomize the initial circid and streamid values, so an adversary who
      breaks into a node can't learn how many circuits or streams have
      been made so far.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre16 - 2003-12-14
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug that made HUP trigger an assert
    - Fixed a bug where a circuit that immediately failed wasn't being
      counted as a failed circuit in counting retries.

  o Features:
    - Now we close the circuit when we get a truncated cell: otherwise we're
      open to an anonymity attack where a bad node in the path truncates
      the circuit and then we open streams at him.
    - Add port ranges to exit policies
    - Add a conservative default exit policy
    - Warn if you're running tor as root
    - on HUP, retry OR connections and close/rebind listeners
    - options.EntryNodes: try these nodes first when picking the first node
    - options.ExitNodes: if your best choices happen to include any of
      your preferred exit nodes, you choose among just those preferred
      exit nodes.
    - options.ExcludedNodes: nodes that are never picked in path building


Changes in version 0.0.2pre15 - 2003-12-03
  o Robustness and bugfixes:
    - Sometimes clients would cache incorrect DNS resolves, which would
      really screw things up.
    - An OP that goes offline would slowly leak all its sockets and stop
      working.
    - A wide variety of bugfixes in exit node selection, exit policy
      handling, and processing pending streams when a new circuit is
      established.
    - Pick nodes for a path only from those the directory says are up
    - Choose randomly from all running dirservers, not always the first one
    - Increase allowed http header size for directory fetch.
    - Stop writing to stderr (if we're daemonized it will be closed).
    - Enable -g always, so cores will be more useful to me.
    - Switch "-lcrypto -lssl" to "-lssl -lcrypto" for broken distributions.

  o Documentation:
    - Wrote a man page. It lists commonly used options.

  o Configuration:
    - Change default loglevel to warn.
    - Make PidFile default to null rather than littering in your CWD.
    - OnionRouter config option is now obsolete. Instead it just checks
      ORPort>0.
    - Moved to a single unified torrc file for both clients and servers.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre14 - 2003-11-29
  o Robustness and bugfixes:
    - Force the admin to make the DataDirectory himself
      - to get ownership/permissions right
      - so clients no longer make a DataDirectory and then never use it
    - fix bug where a client who was offline for 45 minutes would never
      pull down a directory again
    - fix (or at least hide really well) the dns assert bug that was
      causing server crashes
    - warnings and improved robustness wrt clockskew for certs
    - use the native daemon(3) to daemonize, when available
    - exit if bind() fails
    - exit if neither socksport nor orport is defined
    - include our own tor_timegm (Win32 doesn't have its own)
    - bugfix for win32 with lots of connections
    - fix minor bias in PRNG
    - make dirserver more robust to corrupt cached directory

  o Documentation:
    - Wrote the design document (woo)

  o Circuit building and exit policies:
    - Circuits no longer try to use nodes that the directory has told them
      are down.
    - Exit policies now support bitmasks (18.0.0.0/255.0.0.0) and
      bitcounts (18.0.0.0/8).
    - Make AP connections standby for a circuit if no suitable circuit
      exists, rather than failing
    - Circuits choose exit node based on addr/port, exit policies, and
      which AP connections are standing by
    - Bump min pathlen from 2 to 3
    - Relay end cells have a payload to describe why the stream ended.
    - If the stream failed because of exit policy, try again with a new
      circuit.
    - Clients have a dns cache to remember resolved addresses.
    - Notice more quickly when we have no working circuits

  o Configuration:
    - APPort is now called SocksPort
    - SocksBindAddress, ORBindAddress, DirBindAddress let you configure
      where to bind
    - RecommendedVersions is now a config variable rather than
      hardcoded (for dirservers)
    - Reloads config on HUP
    - Usage info on -h or --help
    - If you set User and Group config vars, it'll setu/gid to them.

Changes in version 0.0.2pre13 - 2003-10-19
  o General stability:
    - SSL_write no longer fails when it returns WANTWRITE and the number
      of bytes in the buf has changed by the next SSL_write call.
    - Fix segfault fetching directory when network is down
    - Fix a variety of minor memory leaks
    - Dirservers reload the fingerprints file on HUP, so I don't have
      to take down the network when I approve a new router
    - Default server config file has explicit Address line to specify fqdn

  o Buffers:
    - Buffers grow and shrink as needed (Cut process size from 20M to 2M)
    - Make listener connections not ever alloc bufs

  o Autoconf improvements:
    - don't clobber an external CFLAGS in ./configure
    - Make install now works
    - create var/lib/tor on make install
    - autocreate a tor.sh initscript to help distribs
    - autocreate the torrc and sample-server-torrc with correct paths

  o Log files and Daemonizing now work:
    - If --DebugLogFile is specified, log to it at -l debug
    - If --LogFile is specified, use it instead of commandline
    - If --RunAsDaemon is set, tor forks and backgrounds on startup
