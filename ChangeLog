Release notes in progress for 0.0.8:
rc2:
  o Make it compile on cygwin again.
  o When picking unverified routers, skip those with low uptime and/or
    low bandwidth, depending on what properties you care about.

rc1:
  o Changes from 0.0.7.3:
    - Bugfixes:
      - Fix assert triggers: if the other side returns an address 0.0.0.0,
        don't put it into the client dns cache.
      - If a begin failed due to exit policy, but we believe the IP
        address should have been allowed, switch that router to exitpolicy
        reject *:* until we get our next directory.
    - Features:
      - Clients choose nodes proportional to advertised bandwidth.
      - Avoid using nodes with low uptime as introduction points.
      - Handle servers with dynamic IP addresses: don't replace
        options->Address with the resolved one at startup, and
        detect our address right before we make a routerinfo each time.
      - 'FascistFirewall' option to pick dirservers and ORs on specific
        ports; plus 'FirewallPorts' config option to tell FascistFirewall
        which ports are open. (Defaults to 80,443)
      - Be more aggressive about trying to make circuits when the network
        has changed (e.g. when you unsuspend your laptop).
      - Check for time skew on http headers; report date in response to
        "GET /".
      - If the entrynode config line has only one node, don't pick it as
        an exitnode.
      - Add strict{entry|exit}nodes config options. If set to 1, then
        we refuse to build circuits that don't include the specified entry
        or exit nodes.
      - OutboundBindAddress config option, to bind to a specific
        IP address for outgoing connect()s.
      - End truncated log entries (e.g. directories) with "[truncated]".

  o Patches to 0.0.8preX:
    - Bugfixes:
      - Patches to compile and run on win32 again (maybe)?
      - Fix crash when looking for ~/.torrc with no $HOME set.
      - Fix a race bug in the unit tests.
      - Handle verified/unverified name collisions better when new
        routerinfo's arrive in a directory.
      - Sometimes routers were getting entered into the stats before
        we'd assigned their identity_digest. Oops.
      - Only pick and establish intro points after we've gotten a
        directory.
    - Features:
      - AllowUnverifiedNodes config option to let circuits choose no-name
        routers in entry,middle,exit,introduction,rendezvous positions.
        Allow middle and rendezvous positions by default.
      - Add a man page for tor-resolve.

pre3:
  o Changes from 0.0.7.2:
    - Allow multiple ORs with same nickname in routerlist -- now when
      people give us one identity key for a nickname, then later
      another, we don't constantly complain until the first expires.
    - Remember used bandwidth (both in and out), and publish 15-minute
      snapshots for the past day into our descriptor.
    - You can now fetch $DIRURL/running-routers to get just the
      running-routers line, not the whole descriptor list. (But
      clients don't use this yet.)
    - When people mistakenly use Tor as an http proxy, point them
      at the tor-doc.html rather than the INSTALL.
    - Remove our mostly unused -- and broken -- hex_encode()
      function. Use base16_encode() instead. (Thanks to Timo Lindfors
      for pointing out this bug.)
    - Rotate onion keys every 12 hours, not every 2 hours, so we have
      fewer problems with people using the wrong key.
    - Change the default exit policy to reject the default edonkey,
      kazaa, gnutella ports.
    - Add replace_file() to util.[ch] to handle win32's rename().

  o Changes from 0.0.8preX:
    - Fix two bugs in saving onion keys to disk when rotating, so
      hopefully we'll get fewer people using old onion keys.
    - Fix an assert error that was making SocksPolicy not work.
    - Be willing to expire routers that have an open dirport -- it's
      just the authoritative dirservers we want to not forget.
    - Reject tor-resolve requests for .onion addresses early, so we
      don't build a whole rendezvous circuit and then fail.
    - When you're warning a server that he's unverified, don't cry
      wolf unpredictably.
    - Fix a race condition: don't try to extend onto a connection
      that's still handshaking.
    - For servers in clique mode, require the conn to be open before
      you'll choose it for your path.
    - Fix some cosmetic bugs about duplicate mark-for-close, lack of
      end relay cell, etc.
    - Measure bandwidth capacity over the last 24 hours, not just 12
    - Bugfix: authoritative dirservers were making and signing a new
      directory for each client, rather than reusing the cached one.

pre2:
  o Changes from 0.0.7.2:
    - Security fixes:
      - Check directory signature _before_ you decide whether you're
        you're running an obsolete version and should exit.
      - Check directory signature _before_ you parse the running-routers
        list to decide who's running or verified.
    - Bugfixes and features:
      - Check return value of fclose while writing to disk, so we don't
        end up with broken files when servers run out of disk space.
      - Log a warning if the user uses an unsafe socks variant, so people
        are more likely to learn about privoxy or socat.
      - Dirservers now include RFC1123-style dates in the HTTP headers,
        which one day we will use to better detect clock skew.

  o Changes from 0.0.8pre1:
    - Make it compile without warnings again on win32.
    - Log a warning if you're running an unverified server, to let you
      know you might want to get it verified.
    - Only pick a default nickname if you plan to be a server.

pre1:
  o Bugfixes:
    - Made our unit tests compile again on OpenBSD 3.5, and tor
      itself compile again on OpenBSD on a sparc64.
    - We were neglecting milliseconds when logging on win32, so
      everything appeared to happen at the beginning of each second.

  o Protocol changes:
    - 'Extend' relay cell payloads now include the digest of the
      intended next hop's identity key. Now we can verify that we're
      extending to the right router, and also extend to routers we
      hadn't heard of before.

  o Features:
    - Tor nodes can now act as relays (with an advertised ORPort)
      without being manually verified by the dirserver operators.
      - Uploaded descriptors of unverified routers are now accepted
        by the dirservers, and included in the directory.
      - Verified routers are listed by nickname in the running-routers
        list; unverified routers are listed as "$<fingerprint>".
      - We now use hash-of-identity-key in most places rather than
        nickname or addr:port, for improved security/flexibility.
      - To avoid Sybil attacks, paths still use only verified servers.
        But now we have a chance to play around with hybrid approaches.
      - Nodes track bandwidth usage to estimate capacity (not used yet).
      - ClientOnly option for nodes that never want to become servers.
    - Directory caching.
      - "AuthoritativeDir 1" option for the official dirservers.
      - Now other nodes (clients and servers) will cache the latest
        directory they've pulled down.
      - They can enable their DirPort to serve it to others.
      - Clients will pull down a directory from any node with an open
        DirPort, and check the signature/timestamp correctly.
      - Authoritative dirservers now fetch directories from other
        authdirservers, to stay better synced.
      - Running-routers list tells who's down also, along with noting
        if they're verified (listed by nickname) or unverified (listed
        by hash-of-key).
      - Allow dirservers to serve running-router list separately.
        This isn't used yet.
    - ORs connect-on-demand to other ORs
      - If you get an extend cell to an OR you're not connected to,
        connect, handshake, and forward the create cell.
      - The authoritative dirservers stay connected to everybody,
        and everybody stays connected to 0.0.7 servers, but otherwise
        clients/servers expire unused connections after 5 minutes.
    - When servers get a sigint, they delay 30 seconds (refusing new
      connections) then exit. A second sigint causes immediate exit.
    - File and name management:
      - Look for .torrc if no CONFDIR "torrc" is found.
      - If no datadir is defined, then choose, make, and secure ~/.tor
        as datadir.
      - If torrc not found, exitpolicy reject *:*.
      - Expands ~/ in filenames to $HOME/ (but doesn't yet expand ~arma).
      - If no nickname is defined, derive default from hostname.
      - Rename secret key files, e.g. identity.key -> secret_id_key,
        to discourage people from mailing their identity key to tor-ops.
    - Refuse to build a circuit before the directory has arrived --
      it won't work anyway, since you won't know the right onion keys
      to use.
    - Try other dirservers immediately if the one you try is down. This
      should tolerate down dirservers better now.
    - Parse tor version numbers so we can do an is-newer-than check
      rather than an is-in-the-list check.
    - New socks command 'resolve', to let us shim gethostbyname()
      locally.
      - A 'tor_resolve' script to access the socks resolve functionality.
      - A new socks-extensions.txt doc file to describe our
        interpretation and extensions to the socks protocols.
    - Add a ContactInfo option, which gets published in descriptor.
    - Publish OR uptime in descriptor (and thus in directory) too.
    - Write tor version at the top of each log file
    - New docs in the tarball:
      - tor-doc.html.
      - Document that you should proxy your SSL traffic too.


Changes in version 0.0.7.3 - 2004-08-12
  o Stop dnsworkers from triggering an assert failure when you
    ask them to resolve the host "".


Changes in version 0.0.7.2 - 2004-07-07
  o A better fix for the 0.0.0.0 problem, that will hopefully
    eliminate the remaining related assertion failures.


Changes in version 0.0.7.1 - 2004-07-04
  o When an address resolves to 0.0.0.0, treat it as a failed resolve,
    since internally we use 0.0.0.0 to signify "not yet resolved".


Changes in version 0.0.7 - 2004-06-07
  o Fixes for crashes and other obnoxious bugs:
    - Fix an epipe bug: sometimes when directory connections failed
      to connect, we would give them a chance to flush before closing
      them.
    - When we detached from a circuit because of resolvefailed, we
      would immediately try the same circuit twice more, and then
      give up on the resolve thinking we'd tried three different
      exit nodes.
    - Limit the number of intro circuits we'll attempt to build for a
      hidden service per 15-minute period.
    - Check recommended-software string *early*, before actually parsing
      the directory. Thus we can detect an obsolete version and exit,
      even if the new directory format doesn't parse.
  o Fixes for security bugs:
    - Remember which nodes are dirservers when you startup, and if a
      random OR enables his dirport, don't automatically assume he's
      a trusted dirserver.
  o Other bugfixes:
    - Directory connections were asking the wrong poll socket to
      start writing, and not asking themselves to start writing.
    - When we detached from a circuit because we sent a begin but
      didn't get a connected, we would use it again the first time;
      but after that we would correctly switch to a different one.
    - Stop warning when the first onion decrypt attempt fails; they
      will sometimes legitimately fail now that we rotate keys.
    - Override unaligned-access-ok check when $host_cpu is ia64 or
      arm. Apparently they allow it but the kernel whines.
    - Dirservers try to reconnect periodically too, in case connections
      have failed.
    - Fix some memory leaks in directory servers.
    - Allow backslash in Win32 filenames.
    - Made Tor build complain-free on FreeBSD, hopefully without
      breaking other BSD builds. We'll see.
    - Check directory signatures based on name of signer, not on whom
      we got the directory from. This will let us cache directories more
      easily.
    - Rotate dnsworkers and cpuworkers on SIGHUP, so they get new config
      settings too.
  o Features:
    - Doxygen markup on all functions and global variables.
    - Make directory functions update routerlist, not replace it. So
      now directory disagreements are not so critical a problem.
    - Remove the upper limit on number of descriptors in a dirserver's
      directory (not that we were anywhere close).
    - Allow multiple logfiles at different severity ranges.
    - Allow *BindAddress to specify ":port" rather than setting *Port
      separately. Allow multiple instances of each BindAddress config
      option, so you can bind to multiple interfaces if you want.
    - Allow multiple exit policy lines, which are processed in order.
      Now we don't need that huge line with all the commas in it.
    - Enable accept/reject policies on SOCKS connections, so you can bind
      to 0.0.0.0 but still control who can use your OP.
    - Updated the man page to reflect these features.


Changes in version 0.0.6.2 - 2004-05-16
  o Our integrity-checking digest was checking only the most recent cell,
    not the previous cells like we'd thought.
    Thanks to Stefan Mark for finding the flaw!


Changes in version 0.0.6.1 - 2004-05-06
  o Fix two bugs in our AES counter-mode implementation (this affected
    onion-level stream encryption, but not TLS-level). It turns
    out we were doing something much more akin to a 16-character
    polyalphabetic cipher. Oops.
    Thanks to Stefan Mark for finding the flaw!
  o Retire moria3 as a directory server, and add tor26 as a directory
    server.


Changes in version 0.0.6 - 2004-05-02
  o Features:
    - Hidden services and rendezvous points are implemented. Go to
      http://6sxoyfb3h2nvok2d.onion/ for an index of currently available
      hidden services. (This only works via a socks4a proxy such as
      Privoxy, and currently it's quite slow.)
    - We now rotate link (tls context) keys and onion keys.
    - CREATE cells now include oaep padding, so you can tell
      if you decrypted them correctly.
    - Retry stream correctly when we fail to connect because of
      exit-policy-reject (should try another) or can't-resolve-address.
    - When we hup a dirserver and we've *removed* a server from the
      approved-routers list, now we remove that server from the
      in-memory directories too.
    - Add bandwidthburst to server descriptor.
    - Directories now say which dirserver signed them.
    - Use a tor_assert macro that logs failed assertions too.
    - Since we don't support truncateds much, don't bother sending them;
      just close the circ.
    - Fetch randomness from /dev/urandom better (not via fopen/fread)
    - Better debugging for tls errors
    - Set Content-Type on the directory and hidserv descriptor.
    - Remove IVs from cipher code, since AES-ctr has none.
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix an assert trigger for exit nodes that's been plaguing us since
      the days of 0.0.2prexx (thanks weasel!)
    - Fix a bug where we were closing tls connections intermittently.
      It turns out openssl keeps its errors around -- so if an error
      happens, and you don't ask about it, and then another openssl
      operation happens and succeeds, and you ask if there was an error,
      it tells you about the first error.
    - Fix a bug that's been lurking since 27 may 03 (!)
      When passing back a destroy cell, we would use the wrong circ id.
    - Don't crash if a conn that sent a begin has suddenly lost its circuit.
    - Some versions of openssl have an SSL_pending function that erroneously
      returns bytes when there is a non-application record pending.
    - Win32 fixes. Tor now compiles on win32 with no warnings/errors.
      o We were using an array of length zero in a few places.
      o Win32's gethostbyname can't resolve an IP to an IP.
      o Win32's close can't close a socket.
      o Handle windows socket errors correctly.
  o Portability:
    - check for <sys/limits.h> so we build on FreeBSD again, and
      <machine/limits.h> for NetBSD.


Changes in version 0.0.5 - 2004-03-30
  o Install torrc as torrc.sample -- we no longer clobber your
    torrc. (Woo!)
  o Fix mangled-state bug in directory fetching (was causing sigpipes).
  o Only build circuits after we've fetched the directory: clients were
    using only the directory servers before they'd fetched a directory.
    This also means longer startup time; so it goes.
  o Fix an assert trigger where an OP would fail to handshake, and we'd
    expect it to have a nickname.
  o Work around a tsocks bug: do a socks reject when AP connection dies
    early, else tsocks goes into an infinite loop.
  o Hold socks connection open until reply is flushed (if possible)
  o Make exit nodes resolve IPs to IPs immediately, rather than asking
    the dns farm to do it.
  o Fix c99 aliasing warnings in rephist.c
  o Don't include server descriptors that are older than 24 hours in the
    directory.
  o Give socks 'reject' replies their whole 15s to attempt to flush,
    rather than seeing the 60s timeout and assuming the flush had failed.
  o Clean automake droppings from the cvs repository
  o Add in a 'notice' log level for things the operator should hear
    but that aren't warnings


Changes in version 0.0.4 - 2004-03-26
  o When connecting to a dirserver or OR and the network is down,
    we would crash.


Changes in version 0.0.3 - 2004-03-26
  o Warn and fail if server chose a nickname with illegal characters
  o Port to Solaris and Sparc:
    - include missing header fcntl.h
    - have autoconf find -lsocket -lnsl automatically
    - deal with hardware word alignment
    - make uname() work (solaris has a different return convention)
    - switch from using signal() to sigaction()
  o Preliminary work on reputation system:
    - Keep statistics on success/fail of connect attempts; they're published
      by kill -USR1 currently.
    - Add a RunTesting option to try to learn link state by creating test
      circuits, even when SocksPort is off.
    - Remove unused open circuits when there are too many.


Changes in version 0.0.2 - 2004-03-19
    - Include strlcpy and strlcat for safer string ops
    - define INADDR_NONE so we compile (but still not run) on solaris


Changes in version 0.0.2pre27 - 2004-03-14
  o Bugfixes:
    - Allow internal tor networks (we were rejecting internal IPs,
      now we allow them if they're set explicitly).
    - And fix a few endian issues.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre26 - 2004-03-14
  o New features:
    - If a stream times out after 15s without a connected cell, don't
      try that circuit again: try a new one.
    - Retry streams at most 4 times. Then give up.
    - When a dirserver gets a descriptor from an unknown router, it
      logs its fingerprint (so the dirserver operator can choose to
      accept it even without mail from the server operator).
    - Inform unapproved servers when we reject their descriptors.
    - Make tor build on Windows again. It works as a client, who knows
      about as a server.
    - Clearer instructions in the torrc for how to set up a server.
    - Be more efficient about reading fd's when our global token bucket
      (used for rate limiting) becomes empty.
  o Bugfixes:
    - Stop asserting that computers always go forward in time. It's
      simply not true.
    - When we sent a cell (e.g. destroy) and then marked an OR connection
      expired, we might close it before finishing a flush if the other
      side isn't reading right then.
    - Don't allow dirservers to start if they haven't defined
      RecommendedVersions
    - We were caching transient dns failures. Oops.
    - Prevent servers from publishing an internal IP as their address.
    - Address a strcat vulnerability in circuit.c


Changes in version 0.0.2pre25 - 2004-03-04
  o New features:
    - Put the OR's IP in its router descriptor, not its fqdn. That way
      we'll stop being stalled by gethostbyname for nodes with flaky dns,
      e.g. poblano.
  o Bugfixes:
    - If the user typed in an address that didn't resolve, the server
      crashed.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre24 - 2004-03-03
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix an assertion failure in dns.c, where we were trying to dequeue
      a pending dns resolve even if it wasn't pending
    - Fix a spurious socks5 warning about still trying to write after the
      connection is finished.
    - Hold certain marked_for_close connections open until they're finished
      flushing, rather than losing bytes by closing them too early.
    - Correctly report the reason for ending a stream
    - Remove some duplicate calls to connection_mark_for_close
    - Put switch_id and start_daemon earlier in the boot sequence, so it
      will actually try to chdir() to options.DataDirectory
    - Make 'make test' exit(1) if a test fails; fix some unit tests
    - Make tor fail when you use a config option it doesn't know about,
      rather than warn and continue.
    - Make --version work
    - Bugfixes on the rpm spec file and tor.sh, so it's more up to date


Changes in version 0.0.2pre23 - 2004-02-29
  o New features:
    - Print a statement when the first circ is finished, so the user
      knows it's working.
    - If a relay cell is unrecognized at the end of the circuit,
      send back a destroy. (So attacks to mutate cells are more
      clearly thwarted.)
    - New config option 'excludenodes' to avoid certain nodes for circuits.
    - When it daemonizes, it chdir's to the DataDirectory rather than "/",
      so you can collect coredumps there.
 o Bugfixes:
    - Fix a bug in tls flushing where sometimes data got wedged and
      didn't flush until more data got sent. Hopefully this bug was
      a big factor in the random delays we were seeing.
    - Make 'connected' cells include the resolved IP, so the client
      dns cache actually gets populated.
    - Disallow changing from ORPort=0 to ORPort>0 on hup.
    - When we time-out on a stream and detach from the circuit, send an
      end cell down it first.
    - Only warn about an unknown router (in exitnodes, entrynodes,
      excludenodes) after we've fetched a directory.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre22 - 2004-02-26
  o New features:
    - Servers publish less revealing uname information in descriptors.
    - More memory tracking and assertions, to crash more usefully when
      errors happen.
    - If the default torrc isn't there, just use some default defaults.
      Plus provide an internal dirservers file if they don't have one.
    - When the user tries to use Tor as an http proxy, give them an http
      501 failure explaining that we're a socks proxy.
    - Dump a new router.desc on hup, to help confused people who change
      their exit policies and then wonder why router.desc doesn't reflect
      it.
    - Clean up the generic tor.sh init script that we ship with.
  o Bugfixes:
    - If the exit stream is pending on the resolve, and a destroy arrives,
      then the stream wasn't getting removed from the pending list. I
      think this was the one causing recent server crashes.
    - Use a more robust poll on OSX 10.3, since their poll is flaky.
    - When it couldn't resolve any dirservers, it was useless from then on.
      Now it reloads the RouterFile (or default dirservers) if it has no
      dirservers.
    - Move the 'tor' binary back to /usr/local/bin/ -- it turns out
      many users don't even *have* a /usr/local/sbin/.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre21 - 2004-02-18
  o New features:
    - There's a ChangeLog file that actually reflects the changelog.
    - There's a 'torify' wrapper script, with an accompanying
      tor-tsocks.conf, that simplifies the process of using tsocks for
      tor. It even has a man page.
    - The tor binary gets installed to sbin rather than bin now.
    - Retry streams where the connected cell hasn't arrived in 15 seconds
    - Clean up exit policy handling -- get the default out of the torrc,
      so we can update it without forcing each server operator to fix
      his/her torrc.
    - Allow imaps and pop3s in default exit policy
  o Bugfixes:
    - Prevent picking middleman nodes as the last node in the circuit


Changes in version 0.0.2pre20 - 2004-01-30
  o New features:
    - We now have a deb package, and it's in debian unstable. Go to
      it, apt-getters. :)
    - I've split the TotalBandwidth option into BandwidthRate (how many
      bytes per second you want to allow, long-term) and
      BandwidthBurst (how many bytes you will allow at once before the cap
      kicks in).  This better token bucket approach lets you, say, set
      BandwidthRate to 10KB/s and BandwidthBurst to 10MB, allowing good
      performance while not exceeding your monthly bandwidth quota.
    - Push out a tls record's worth of data once you've got it, rather
      than waiting until you've read everything waiting to be read. This
      may improve performance by pipelining better. We'll see.
    - Add an AP_CONN_STATE_CONNECTING state, to allow streams to detach
      from failed circuits (if they haven't been connected yet) and attach
      to new ones.
    - Expire old streams that haven't managed to connect. Some day we'll
      have them reattach to new circuits instead.

  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix several memory leaks that were causing servers to become bloated
      after a while.
    - Fix a few very rare assert triggers. A few more remain.
    - Setuid to User _before_ complaining about running as root.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre19 - 2004-01-07
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix deadlock condition in dns farm. We were telling a child to die by
      closing the parent's file descriptor to him. But newer children were
      inheriting the open file descriptor from the parent, and since they
      weren't closing it, the socket never closed, so the child never read
      eof, so he never knew to exit. Similarly, dns workers were holding
      open other sockets, leading to all sorts of chaos.
    - New cleaner daemon() code for forking and backgrounding.
    - If you log to a file, it now prints an entry at the top of the
      logfile so you know it's working.
    - The onionskin challenge length was 30 bytes longer than necessary.
    - Started to patch up the spec so it's not quite so out of date.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre18 - 2004-01-02
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fix endian issues with the 'integrity' field in the relay header.
    - Fix a potential bug where connections in state
      AP_CONN_STATE_CIRCUIT_WAIT might unexpectedly ask to write.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre17 - 2003-12-30
  o Bugfixes:
    - Made --debuglogfile (or any second log file, actually) work.
    - Resolved an edge case in get_unique_circ_id_by_conn where a smart
      adversary could force us into an infinite loop.

  o Features:
    - Each onionskin handshake now includes a hash of the computed key,
      to prove the server's identity and help perfect forward secrecy.
    - Changed cell size from 256 to 512 bytes (working toward compatibility
      with MorphMix).
    - Changed cell length to 2 bytes, and moved it to the relay header.
    - Implemented end-to-end integrity checking for the payloads of
      relay cells.
    - Separated streamid from 'recognized' (otherwise circuits will get
      messed up when we try to have streams exit from the middle). We
      use the integrity-checking to confirm that a cell is addressed to
      this hop.
    - Randomize the initial circid and streamid values, so an adversary who
      breaks into a node can't learn how many circuits or streams have
      been made so far.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre16 - 2003-12-14
  o Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug that made HUP trigger an assert
    - Fixed a bug where a circuit that immediately failed wasn't being
      counted as a failed circuit in counting retries.

  o Features:
    - Now we close the circuit when we get a truncated cell: otherwise we're
      open to an anonymity attack where a bad node in the path truncates
      the circuit and then we open streams at him.
    - Add port ranges to exit policies
    - Add a conservative default exit policy
    - Warn if you're running tor as root
    - on HUP, retry OR connections and close/rebind listeners
    - options.EntryNodes: try these nodes first when picking the first node
    - options.ExitNodes: if your best choices happen to include any of
      your preferred exit nodes, you choose among just those preferred
      exit nodes.
    - options.ExcludedNodes: nodes that are never picked in path building


Changes in version 0.0.2pre15 - 2003-12-03
  o Robustness and bugfixes:
    - Sometimes clients would cache incorrect DNS resolves, which would
      really screw things up.
    - An OP that goes offline would slowly leak all its sockets and stop
      working.
    - A wide variety of bugfixes in exit node selection, exit policy
      handling, and processing pending streams when a new circuit is
      established.
    - Pick nodes for a path only from those the directory says are up
    - Choose randomly from all running dirservers, not always the first one
    - Increase allowed http header size for directory fetch.
    - Stop writing to stderr (if we're daemonized it will be closed).
    - Enable -g always, so cores will be more useful to me.
    - Switch "-lcrypto -lssl" to "-lssl -lcrypto" for broken distributions.

  o Documentation:
    - Wrote a man page. It lists commonly used options.

  o Configuration:
    - Change default loglevel to warn.
    - Make PidFile default to null rather than littering in your CWD.
    - OnionRouter config option is now obsolete. Instead it just checks
      ORPort>0.
    - Moved to a single unified torrc file for both clients and servers.


Changes in version 0.0.2pre14 - 2003-11-29
  o Robustness and bugfixes:
    - Force the admin to make the DataDirectory himself
      - to get ownership/permissions right
      - so clients no longer make a DataDirectory and then never use it
    - fix bug where a client who was offline for 45 minutes would never
      pull down a directory again
    - fix (or at least hide really well) the dns assert bug that was
      causing server crashes
    - warnings and improved robustness wrt clockskew for certs
    - use the native daemon(3) to daemonize, when available
    - exit if bind() fails
    - exit if neither socksport nor orport is defined
    - include our own tor_timegm (Win32 doesn't have its own)
    - bugfix for win32 with lots of connections
    - fix minor bias in PRNG
    - make dirserver more robust to corrupt cached directory

  o Documentation:
    - Wrote the design document (woo)

  o Circuit building and exit policies:
    - Circuits no longer try to use nodes that the directory has told them
      are down.
    - Exit policies now support bitmasks (18.0.0.0/255.0.0.0) and
      bitcounts (18.0.0.0/8).
    - Make AP connections standby for a circuit if no suitable circuit
      exists, rather than failing
    - Circuits choose exit node based on addr/port, exit policies, and
      which AP connections are standing by
    - Bump min pathlen from 2 to 3
    - Relay end cells have a payload to describe why the stream ended.
    - If the stream failed because of exit policy, try again with a new
      circuit.
    - Clients have a dns cache to remember resolved addresses.
    - Notice more quickly when we have no working circuits

  o Configuration:
    - APPort is now called SocksPort
    - SocksBindAddress, ORBindAddress, DirBindAddress let you configure
      where to bind
    - RecommendedVersions is now a config variable rather than
      hardcoded (for dirservers)
    - Reloads config on HUP
    - Usage info on -h or --help
    - If you set User and Group config vars, it'll setu/gid to them.

Changes in version 0.0.2pre13 - 2003-10-19
  o General stability:
    - SSL_write no longer fails when it returns WANTWRITE and the number
      of bytes in the buf has changed by the next SSL_write call.
    - Fix segfault fetching directory when network is down
    - Fix a variety of minor memory leaks
    - Dirservers reload the fingerprints file on HUP, so I don't have
      to take down the network when I approve a new router
    - Default server config file has explicit Address line to specify fqdn

  o Buffers:
    - Buffers grow and shrink as needed (Cut process size from 20M to 2M)
    - Make listener connections not ever alloc bufs

  o Autoconf improvements:
    - don't clobber an external CFLAGS in ./configure
    - Make install now works
    - create var/lib/tor on make install
    - autocreate a tor.sh initscript to help distribs
    - autocreate the torrc and sample-server-torrc with correct paths

  o Log files and Daemonizing now work:
    - If --DebugLogFile is specified, log to it at -l debug
    - If --LogFile is specified, use it instead of commandline
    - If --RunAsDaemon is set, tor forks and backgrounds on startup
